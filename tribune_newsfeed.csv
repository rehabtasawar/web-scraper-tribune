The recent escalation began after India conducted airstrikes in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on May 6–7, which killed over 30 civilians. In response, Pakistan downed five Indian fighter jets and intercepted multiple drones. Subsequent Indian strikes on Pakistani military targets on May 9 prompted Islamabad to launch “Operation Bunyan Marsoos,” targeting Indian military installations while avoiding civilian infrastructure. In an interview with RT Arabic, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that “Pakistan is not a violent nation,” adding that the country's top priority remains peace. ڈی جی آئی ایس پی آر لیفٹینٹ جنرل احمد شریف کی آر ٹی عریبیہ سے خصوصی گفتگو  پاک بھارت تناؤ کو سمجھنے کے لیے اس کے پس منظر میں جانا ضروری ہے ، ڈی جی آئی ایس پی آر  بھارت اس خطے میں، خاص طور پر پاکستان میں، دہشت گردی کی سرپرستی کر رہا ہے، ڈی جی آئی ایس پی آر  بھارت حقیقت چھپانے… pic.twitter.com/XsKVos0aeJ The DG ISPR revealed that the ceasefire was requested by an Indian defence official and facilitated through American mediation. He praised Pakistan's diplomatic efforts during the standoff, calling them mature and effective. He also criticised India for rejecting Pakistan's call for a neutral investigation into the Pahalgam attack in IIOJK, for which New Delhi blamed Islamabad without presenting evidence. “India refused a logical, impartial probe and instead resorted to missile attacks on civilian targets,” he said. The ISPR chief also accused India of sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan, particularly through groups operating in Balochistan. He reiterated that Pakistan’s armed forces remain committed to protecting the country’s sovereignty and will act decisively against any aggression."

Pakistan,Tribune,World Bank-funded project cost doubles after revision,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546440/world-bank-funded-project-cost-doubles-after-revision,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Cost of Pakistan Raises Revenue project increased from Rs12.5 billion to Rs40.8 billion,"The government has made the third revision in the troubled World Bank-funded Pakistan Raises Revenue project and almost doubled the cost to $150 million to upgrade technology and also to procure 179 vehicles, including bullet-proof cars. In rupee terms, the cost was increased from the original price tag of Rs12.5 billion to Rs40.8 billion — a surge of 226% in addition to giving two years' extension in its completion period. The Central Development Working Party (CDWP) on Thursday referred the project to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), said a statement issued by the Planning Ministry on Friday. The CDWP also expanded the scope of Punjab Chief Minister Laptop scheme and increased its cost by 170% to Rs27 billion. The Investment Projects Financing (IPF) component of Pakistan Raises Revenue Project worth Rs40.8 billion was referred to Ecnec for further consideration. The Planning Ministry said the project will be financed through a World Bank loan. The revised project focuses on modernizing the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) infrastructure through the replacement of outdated hardware, deployment of a private cloud, updated software licensing, and enhanced connectivity for field formations. The project documents stated that an amount of Rs2.2 billion has been allocated for procurement of 179 vehicles of different makes at the unit cost of Rs12.5 million for Digital Enforcement Units. These include 15 bullet-proof vehicles. The government had taken a $400 million loan in the name of Pakistan Raises Revenue. Out of which, $80 million had been allocated for hardware upgrading. Now this component has been increased to $150 million. The ministry stated that the FBR's requirements have substantially changed as a result of organization-wide thrust to adopt information and communication technology (ICT) based solutions for its core operations and facilitation of taxpayer, as envisaged under the FBR Transformation Roadmap 2024. The concept clearance proposal of the programme was approved in 2019. Ecnec in 2020 approved the original project at a total cost of Rs12.6 billion. Later on, the first revision of the project was approved by Ecnec in its meeting held in 2023 at a total cost of Rs21.5 billion. Now, the cost is Rs40.8 billion. The project documents underlined that based on discussions and understanding between the FBR and the World Banks's team during Mid-Term Review (MTR) mission aide memoire, the project has been restructured for including additional funding therefore scope of the project has been revised. There are certain changes in implementation strategies for achieving the programme's objectives and goals. The additional funds will be utilized to meet the requirements. These include piloting Mobile Tax Facilitation Services, initiatives for improved taxpayer compliance, establishing forum for technical consultations with provincial tax authorities on tax harmonization, staff capacity building, backup power equipment up-gradation and control rooms, it added. The project has been restructured on instruction of the prime minister and discussions and understanding between the FBR and World Bank's team during the Mid-Term Review mission aide memoire. The FBR had also conducted an inquiry report for identifying external reasons. The delay was because of non-award of contract under original project, lack of adequate rupee cover allocations as a main hindrance in procurement during last three years and the PM's directive to revise PC-I of Pakistan Raises Revenue to include components of the FBR Transformation Plan falling within scope of the project. But the Planning Ministry stated in its comments that these risks should have been catered in the risk mitigation strategy of the project and could have been managed by the project authority. The Planning Ministry recommended fixing the responsibility for the inability to mitigate these risks to complete the project as per its approved scope and time period. The revised project is also aimed at rolling out a Single Sales Tax Return system, development of Data Warehousing and BI tools, and digital transformation of value chains, the components that do not require any foreign loan. The project supports faceless assessments, border technology upgrades, and capacity building through training, expert panels, and IT enhancements, along with business process automation and risk management frameworks, according to the Planning Ministry. The Punjab CM Laptop Scheme worth Rs27 billion was referred to Ecnec for further consideration. The project is funded by the government of Punjab and will be completed by October this year. The project aims to distribute laptops to approximately 112,000 students currently enrolled in public sector educational institutions across Punjab with the final number subject to revised allocations. Targeting students in BS, MS, MBBS, and Engineering programmes, the selection will follow criteria approved by the Steering Committee and be based on verified student data from respective institutions. This initiative seeks to digitally empower students, enhance access to educational resources, reduce socio-economic disparities, and promote equal opportunities. It also aims to foster collaboration with the local ICT industry, support economic growth and entrepreneurship, and invest in human capital by equipping students with the skills needed to compete globally and regionally. To qualify for the laptop, the public sector universities and colleges students should get a minimum of 65% marks in intermediate exams. For public sector medical and dental colleges and universities minimum of 80% marks in intermediate are required. Students must not be a recipient of any laptop from PM laptop programme or any government laptop scheme."

He was addressing a group of students and teachers, who had come to congratulate him at his residence on the success of Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos, a coordinated response by Pakistan's military forces to hostilities by India. ""Our eternal and perpetual enemy is sitting just miles away across the eastern border, licking its wounds,"" he said. ""God willing, our enemies on the western front will soon suffer the same fate."" Khawaja Asif said there was no need to respond to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi anymore. ""What is being said about him across India today, we ourselves could not have said it better,"" he added, referring to growing internal discontent within India. He credited the operation with uniting the country at a time when visible fissures had appeared in the national fabric. ""Fifteen or twenty days ago, we saw cracks in our national unity. Today, by the grace of God, the nation is united, and that unity now bears the mark of our armed forces' bravery. I salute them,"" he said. The minister extended his congratulations to the top military leadership, including Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar, Naval Chief Naveed Ashraf and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad, for their courageous and faith-driven leadership during the operation. ""I have witnessed conflicts from very close quarters — from the 1965 war to today — but I have never seen such an emotionally charged and spiritually driven leadership,"" he said. ""It was your leadership that instilled strength in our soldiers. I am a direct witness to your resolve and bravery."" Asif also praised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the armed forces at every moment of the crisis. ""He led the nation, conveyed to the military that the civilian government fully supports them, and assured them that it stands beside them with the strength of 250 million people,"" the minister said. ""No matter how far we have to go to defend the homeland, we are united under one banner."" He warned that nations which forget their history are themselves forgotten by history."
Pakistan,Tribune,Govt to dissolve Imran's flagship project,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546433/govt-to-dissolve-imrans-flagship-project,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to dissolve the Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (NAPHDA),"Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to dissolve the Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (NAPHDA), a flagship project of former prime minister Imran Khan's government. Reliable sources confirmed that PM Sharif has decided to wind up the authority, a national construction organization responsible for the planning, development, construction and management of real estate projects across the country. In this regard, the contract of Major General (retd) Amir Aslam Khan, the current NAPHDA chairman, has not been renewed.

The authority had an annual budget of Rs400 million, and over the past five years, its total budget reached Rs2 billion yet its output remained zero, sources added. The NAPHDA was established on January 15, 2020. The Senate of Pakistan passed the Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority Bill in 2019."
Pakistan,Tribune,IMF slaps 11 new conditions on Pakistan,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546475/imf-slaps-11-new-conditions-on-pakistan,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Foreign lender releases Staff Level report,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has slapped 11 new conditions on Pakistan, including approval of a new Rs17.6 trillion worth budget, increasing debt servicing surcharge on electricity bills and lifting restrictions on the import of more than three years old used cars. The Staff Level report, which the IMF released on Saturday, also said that ""rising tensions between India and Pakistan, if sustained or deteriorate further, could heighten risks to the fiscal, external and reform goals of the programme"". The report further stated that tensions between Pakistan and India have risen significantly over the past two weeks but so far the market reaction has been modest with the stock market retaining most of its recent gains and spreads widening moderately. The IMF has shown the defense budget for the next fiscal year at Rs2.414 trillion, which is higher by Rs252 billion or 12%. Compared to the IMF's projection, the government has indicated allocating over Rs2.5 trillion or 18% higher budget after India's naked aggression. The report revealed that the IMF has slapped 11 more conditions on Pakistan for the sake of just $7 billion lending, taking the total conditions to 50. It has imposed a new condition of securing ""parliamentary approval of the fiscal year 2026 budget in line with the IMF staff agreement to meet programme targets by end-June 2025"". The IMF has shown the total size of the federal budget at Rs17.6 trillion, including Rs1.07 trillion for the development spending. The Express Tribune had reported a few days ago that the government would present over Rs17.5 trillion budget. The IMF has shown interest spending at Rs8.7 trillion, the primary budget surplus at Rs2.1 trillion and the overall deficit at Rs6.6 trillion. A new condition has also been imposed on the provinces where the four federating units will implement the new Agriculture Income Tax laws through a comprehensive plan, including the establishment of an operational platform for processing returns, taxpayer identification and registration, a communication campaign, and a compliance improvement plan. The deadline for the provinces is June this year. According to the third new condition, the government will publish a governance action plan based on the recommendations of the Governance Diagnostic Assessment by the IMF. The purpose of the report is to publicly identify reform measures to address critical governance vulnerabilities. The fourth new condition states that the government will give annual inflation adjustment of the unconditional cash transfer programme to maintain people real purchasing power Another new condition states that the government will prepare and publish a plan outlining the government's post-2027 financial sector strategy, outlining the institutional and regulatory environment from 2028 onwards. In the energy sector, four new conditions have been introduced. The government will issue notifications of the annual electricity tariff rebasing by July 1st of this year to maintain energy tariffs at cost recovery levels. It will also issue notification of the semi-annual gas tariff adjustment to maintain energy tariffs at cost recovery levels by February 15, 2026, according to the report. Parliament will also adopt legislation to make captive power levy ordinance permanent by the end of this month, according to the IMF. The government has increased the cost for the industries to force them to shift to the national electricity grid. Parliament will also adopt legislation to remove the maximum Rs3.21 per unit cap on the debt service surcharge, which is tantamount to punishing honest electricity consumers to pay for the inefficiency of the power sector. The IMF and the World Bank dictated that wrong energy policies are causing the accumulation of the circular debt in addition to the government's bad governance. The deadline to remove the cap is the end of June, according to the report. The IMF has also imposed a condition that Pakistan will prepare a plan based on the assessment conducted to fully phase out all incentives in relation to Special Technology Zones and other industrial parks and zones by 2035. The report has to be prepared by the end of this year. In a consumer-friendly condition, the IMF has asked Pakistan to submit to the Parliament all required legislation for lifting all quantitative restrictions on the commercial importation of used motor vehicles (initially only for vehicles less than five years old by end of July. Currently only up to three years old cars can be imported and there are many non-tariff barriers to discourage the import. The purpose of lifting these restrictions is liberalizing trade and increasing vehicle affordability, said the IMF. In addition to imposing new conditions, the IMF has also made adjustments in the earlier conditions. Programme Implementation The IMF has extended the deadlines of four conditions whose implementation had been delayed. The lender said that the government met all seven quantitative performance criteria for end-December 2024. These were floors on net international reserves of the SBP; targeted cash transfer spending; the number of new tax returns from new filers, the ceilings on net domestic assets of the SBP; the SBP's FX swaps; the general government primary budget deficit; and government guarantees. The majority of indicative targets were met at end-December, including the ceilings on the aggregate provincial primary budget deficit; net accumulation of tax refund arrears; and power sector payment arrears; the floors on revenues collected by provincial revenue authorities; and the weighted average maturity of local currency debt securities. However, the conditions on the government health and education spending; net tax revenues collected by the FBR; and net tax revenues collected from retailers under the Tajir Dost scheme were missed, said the IMF. The respective governments also met nine structural benchmarks including on approval of a National Fiscal Pact, improving safeguards for monetary policy operations and approval of amendments to bank resolution and deposit legislation. But the structural benchmark on provincial Agricultural Income Tax legislation was not met at the end-October, but this legislation was subsequently passed in February 2025. Another two structural benchmarks were missed due to delays in passing amendments to the Civil Servants and Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) Acts. Two SBs relating to resolving undercapitalized banks and to captive power producers were missed, but subsequent policy actions are expected to accomplish the underlying objectives, said the IMF."

Pakistan,Tribune,Netanyahu isolated in Trump's official Gulf tour,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546519/netanyahu-isolated-in-trumps-official-gulf-tour,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Trump's Gulf tour cements new Sunni-led Mideast order, eclipsing Iran and sidelining Israel, sources say","Nothing captured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's isolation more starkly this week than the image of US President Donald Trump shaking hands with Syria's Islamist leader Ahmed al‑Sharaa - a man Israel has branded ""an al‑Qaeda terrorist in a suit."" ""He's got the potential. He's a real leader,"" Trump told reporters after talks with Sharaa on Wednesday in Riyadh - a meeting brokered by his Saudi hosts, with whom the US president agreed a slew of arms, business and technology deals. Trump's whirlwind four-day tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates this week was more than just a diplomatic spectacle marked by lucrative investments. It sealed the emergence of a new Sunni-led Middle East order - one that eclipses Iran's shattered 'axis of resistance', and leaves Israel sidelined, according to three regional and two Western sources. Amid growing irritation in Washington with Israel's failure to reach a ceasefire in Gaza, Trump's tour was a snub to Netanyahu, a close US ally who was the first foreign leader to visit Washington after the president returned to office in January, the sources said. The message was clear: in Trump's less ideological, more results-driven vision of Middle East diplomacy, Netanyahu could no longer count on unconditional US support for his right-wing agenda, the sources said. ""This administration is very frustrated with Netanyahu and that frustration is showing,"" said David Schenker, a former US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs under Republican former President George W Bush. ""They're very, very transactional, and Netanyahu isn't giving them anything right now."" The sources said that the US was not about to turn its back on Israel, which remains a vital US ally whose support in Washington runs deep and is bipartisan. But the Trump administration wanted to deliver the message to Netanyahu that America has its own interests in the Middle East and it does not like him standing in its way, the sources added. US patience has been strained not just by the Israeli prime minister's refusal to countenance a Gaza ceasefire but also his objection to US talks with Iran over its nuclear program, according to sources familiar with the matter. Netanyahu's office did not respond to requests for comment. It has made no public statements on Trump's regional visit. A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council emphasized Trump was a friend to Israel. ""We continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East,"" NSC spokesman James Hewitt said. While publicly insisting US- Israeli relations remain strong, Trump administration officials have privately expressed irritation with Netanyahu's refusal to fall into line with Washington's positions on Gaza and Iran, according to sources familiar with the matter. Six regional and Western sources said friction between the US and Israel was building before Trump's regional trip. The tension began when Netanyahu flew to Washington on a second visit in April seeking Trump's backing for military strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites - only to discover, to his shock, that Trump was opting for diplomacy. An unbending advocate for a hardline stance against Tehran, Netanyahu was caught off guard, learning just hours before his meeting that negotiations were about to start. In the following weeks, Trump's declaration of a ceasefire with the Houthis in Yemen, rapprochement with Syria's new Islamist leadership and bypassing of Israel on his Gulf visit showed how the traditionally close relations have become strained, the sources said. David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute, where he directs a project on Arab-Israeli relations, said Washington and Tel Aviv ""don't seem in sync on the big questions the way they were in the first hundred days"" of Trump's presidency. During his election campaign, Trump made clear he wanted a ceasefire in Gaza and the hostages there released before he returned to the White House. But months into Trump's presidency, Netanyahu has continued to defy ceasefire calls, expanded the offensive, and offered no endgame or a post-war plan after 19 months of conflict. The death toll in Gaza has passed 52,900 in recent days, according to local health officials. The war - which has sparked international outcry over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza - was triggered by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that killed around 1,200 people and captured some 250 hostages. Any hope that Trump could use his regional visit to cement his image as a peacemaker and announce a deal to end the bitterly divisive war were dashed. Instead, Netanyahu - who is charged with war crimes in Gaza by the International Criminal Court - has doubled-down on his aim of crushing Hamas. Netanyahu is also on trial in Israel over corruption charges, which he denies. As Trump wrapped up his visit, Israel launched a new offensive on Friday in Gaza. Israeli strikes have killed hundreds of Palestinians in recent days. Trump's other key priority - expanding the Abraham Accords establishing diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab states to include Saudi Arabia - has also been blocked by Netanyahu’s intransigence. Riyadh has made it clear it will not normalize relations with Israel until the war has ceased and there is a path to Palestinian statehood, something Netanyahu rejects. ""He's got no strategy, no day-after plan on Gaza,"" Schenker said. ""And he’s standing in the way."" Publicly, Trump himself has dismissed any talk of a rift. In an interview with Fox News, broadcast after the regional visit, Trump denied being frustrated with Netanyahu, who he said faced ""a tough situation"" over the war in Gaza. But Trump is forging ahead without Netanyahu. With unapologetic self-interest, the American president is driving a realignment of U.S. diplomacy toward wealthy Sunni states, anchored by oil-rich Riyadh. One senior regional source said Trump's visit had crowned the influential role of Saudi Arabia as the leader of the Sunni Arab world. By contrast, years of Iranian overreach - and Israel's heavy military blows to its proxies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - have left Shi'ite regional power Tehran diminished. ""Iran had the leading role; now Saudi Arabia has entered with other tools: the economy, money, investment,"" the source said. Although Netanyahu led the fight against Iran, the new regional order is being shaped in Riyadh, Doha and Abu Dhabi. These Gulf monarchies are eager to gain access to sophisticated weaponry to shield them from attacks by Iran and its proxies, as well as to secure advanced US chips and AI technology. They have found a willing partner in a US president whose foreign policy can sometimes blur with his family's financial interests. In Qatar, on the second leg of his tour, Trump was offered a luxuriously outfitted 747 Boeing jet, and welcomed with regal fanfare befitting a monarch. Amid a lavish ceremony, sword dances, a cavalry parade and royal banquet, Trump declared Qatar - which has provided major financial support to Hamas - was ""absolutely trying to help"" with the Israeli hostage crisis. Trump's statement struck a nerve in Jerusalem, where officials view Doha as a strategic threat bankrolling one of their bitterest enemies. Many Israelis ""don't understand just how central Qatar has become to the US "", said Yoel Guzansky, a Senior Fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, noting it hosts the largest US military base in the Middle East. While its ties to Hamas make Qatar a threat to Israel, its vast natural gas wealth, financial clout and diplomatic influence have turned it into an indispensable ally to Washington, Guzanksy added. In total, the White House estimated the tour secured more than $2 trillion in investment commitments for the US economy - including major orders of Boeing planes, deals to buy US defense equipment, data and technology agreements. A Reuters tally of publicly announced deals put the total value at closer to $700 billion. In Saudi Arabia, Trump agreed a record $142 billion arms deal with Riyadh, stoking Israeli fears over losing air superiority in the region if Riyadh gains access to Lockhead's F-35 jet. At the same time, in a recalibration of US -Saudi ties, Trump offered Riyadh leeway on establishing relations with Israel, telling its rulers they could do so in their own time. Now, Trump is negotiating a US-led civil nuclear investment for Saudi Arabia - another deal causing concern in Israel. Sunni states also pushed their own diplomatic agenda. Trump's surprise announcement during his tour that he would lift sanctions against Syria - another major shift in US policy - came at the behest of Saudi Arabia and over the objections of Israel. Until December, when Sharaa toppled Syrian autocrat Bashar al-Assad, Washington had a $10 million reward for his capture. Gulf nations have also applauded Trump's truce with the Houthis in Yemen, part of Iran's regional 'axis of resistance', which put an end to a costly US military operation in the Red Sea. The announcement, which followed the opening of nuclear talks with Iran, came just two days after a Houthi missile struck Israel's Ben Gurion Airport. ""Israel is more and more looking like a spoiler, that stands in the way not just of the US, but the international community, as it tries to shape the region differently after the fall of al-Assad and Hezbollah, and maybe end the Gaza war,"" said Guzansky, a former coordinator of Iran-Gulf affairs at Israel's National Security Council. While Netanyahu's right-wing government has maintained silence on Trump's visit, Israeli media has voiced concern that the country's standing with its most important ally has been eroded. Opposition politicians have criticized the prime minister for leaving Israel sidelined while old alliances are reconfigured. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who is preparing a return to politics, delivered a blistering indictment of Netanyahu's government, capturing the sense of alarm gripping many in Israel's political and security establishment. ""The Middle East is undergoing tectonic changes before our eyes, our enemies are getting stronger, and Netanyahu...and his gang are paralyzed, passive, as if they don't exist,"" the former prime minister and minister of defense said on social media platform X."
Pakistan,Tribune,At least 125 Palestinians killed in ongoing Israeli airstrikes on Gaza,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546501/children-among-33-killed-in-israeli-strikes-on-gaza-say-rescuers,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,International criticism mounted as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate.,"Israeli forces have intensified their assault on Gaza, killing at least 125 Palestinians — including 36 people in al-Mawasi, an area previously designated as a ""safe zone."" The invasion followed Israel's announcement of an expanded military campaign aimed at defeating Hamas. Mahmud Bassal, spokesperson for Gaza’s civil defence, confirmed that 22 people died in a predawn strike targeting tents sheltering displaced civilians in Al-Mawasi. At least 100 others were wounded in the same attack. ""More than half of the martyrs were children,"" Bassal said, describing the overnight offensive as a ""series of violent Israeli air strikes"" that hit several areas of the besieged territory. Footage from AFP TV showed destroyed shelters and frantic rescue efforts, as survivors searched for loved ones. A post shared by CAIR (@cair_national)  Seven more deaths were reported in a separate strike on a house in Jabalia, northern Gaza, where Al-Awda Hospital also sustained damage. Additional casualties occurred in Al-Zawayda and Khan Yunis, bringing the total death toll from Sunday’s strikes to at least 125. The Israeli military has not issued an official statement regarding these specific incidents, but has previously claimed that its attacks are intended to achieve ""all of the war's objectives,"" including dismantling Hamas. International criticism mounted over the weekend as the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. Since March 2, Israel has enforced a blockade severely restricting aid, prompting warnings from UN agencies and humaniytarian agencies about critical shortages of food, water, medicine, and fuel that could lead to risk of famine. UN Secretary-General António Guterres, speaking at an Arab League summit in Baghdad, expressed deep concern at the renewed violence. “I am alarmed by the escalating military attacks. We need a permanent ceasefire, now,” he said. The summit concluded with a unified call for the international community to pressure Israel to end hostilities. European leaders also voiced concern. Italy urged Israel to halt its airstrikes, while Germany said it was “deeply concerned.” European Council President António Costa stated he was “shocked by the news from Gaza.”"
Pakistan,Tribune,Sirbaz Khan becomes first Pakistani to climb all 14 highest peaks without oxygen,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546509/sirbaz-khan-becomes-first-pakistani-to-climb-all-14-highest-peaks-without-oxygen,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Sirbaz is now among a select group of around 70 climbers globally to have summited all 14 peaks.,"Pakistani mountaineer Sirbaz Khan has made history by becoming the first Pakistani to summit all of the world’s 8,000-metre peaks without the use of supplemental oxygen. Sirbaz Khan, who hails from Hunza Valley, reached the top of Kangchenjunga (8,586 metres) on Sunday, completing a years-long campaign across the world’s highest and most dangerous mountains. A post shared by Sirbaz_Mission14 (@sirbazkhan_mission14) While he had previously climbed all 14 peaks by 2024, two of his earlier summits had been made using bottled oxygen. In April 2025, he re-climbed Annapurna, and now Kangchenjunga, both without artificial oxygen, to accomplish the feat under pure alpine style. Sirbaz Khan is now among a select group of around 70 climbers globally to have summited all 14 peaks. Fewer than 25 have done so entirely without supplemental oxygen, a demanding feat that involves climbing in the so-called ""death zone"", where oxygen levels are critically low. His journey began in 2017 with a successful ascent of Nanga Parbat (8,126m), one of the world’s most treacherous mountains. He went on to climb K2 in 2018, Lhotse in 2019 — becoming the first Pakistani to summit it — and Broad Peak without oxygen that same year. In subsequent years, Sirbaz Khan added Manaslu, Annapurna, Everest, Gasherbrum I and II, Dhaulagiri, Makalu, Cho Oyu, and Shishapangma to his record, often as the first Pakistani to do so. Earlier, Sajid Ali Sadpara successfully scaled Dhaulagiri, the world’s seventh-highest mountain at 8,167 metres, without the use of supplemental oxygen."

A speeding tuk-tuk stopped, a man alighted, ran into the queue, and then blew himself up. I saw 10 people dead, including recruits and passers-by. The death toll may rise,"" he said. Dozens of abandoned shoes and the remains of the suicide bomber were visible at the scene. Another witness, Abdisalan Mohamed, said he had seen ""hundreds of teenagers at the gate as we passed by in a bus"". ""Abruptly, a deafening blast occurred, and the area was covered by dense smoke. We could not see the details of casualties,"" he said. Medical staff at the military hospital told Reuters they had received 30 injured people from the blast and that six of them had died immediately. Government forces quickly cordoned off the entire area. In a statement on Sunday Islamist militant group al Shabaab said it was behind the attack and that it had killed as many as 30 soldiers and wounded 50 more. Government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2007, and has recently been battling the army to extend gains in central Somalia. The attack echoed a similar incident in 2023 when a suicide bomber killed 25 soldiers at the Jale Siyad base, located opposite the Damanyo facility. Sunday's attack followed the assassination on Saturday of Colonel Abdirahmaan Hujaale, commander of battalion 26, in the Hiiran region, after local reports of al Shabaab militant infiltration into government and security forces."
Pakistan,Tribune,FBI declares California Palm Spring fertility clinic explosion 'act of terrorism',https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546499/fbi-declares-california-palm-spring-fertility-clinic-explosion-act-of-terrorism,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Law enforcement officials investigating whether blast came from car bomb, whether incident was livestreamed","A deadly explosion outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs has been declared an “intentional act of terrorism” by the FBI, killing one person and injuring four others. The blast, which rocked the upscale California city late Saturday morning, also caused severe damage to several nearby buildings. In a statement shared on social media, the clinic confirmed that none of its staff were injured and that its laboratory — “including all eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials” — remained completely secure and unharmed.  Statement from Palm Springs, CA reproductive center  “…Our lab—including all eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials—remains fully secure and undamaged.” However, one person was found dead and was killed near a vehicle that exploded outside the American Reproductive Centers clinic, according to FBI official Akil Davis. The clinic reported that “a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near our building.” The explosion occurred around 11:00 a.m. local time near the American Reproductive Centers (ARC) on North Indian Canyon Drive. Law enforcement officials are investigating whether the blast came from a car bomb and if the incident was livestreamed. A tripod with a smartphone was found at the scene, raising concerns the attack may have been filmed. Davis, head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, confirmed the attack was intentional and is being investigated as an act of terrorism, though it remains unclear whether it was domestic or international in nature. A “person of interest” has been identified, but authorities are not actively searching for suspects, suggesting the deceased may have been the perpetrator. The identity of the individual killed in the explosion has not yet been confirmed. Officials caution that the investigation is still in its early stages. The injured victims are receiving treatment, though the extent of their injuries has not been disclosed. The ARC clinic confirmed that while its consultation offices were damaged, its IVF laboratory and stored embryos remain unharmed. “Thank God today happened to be a day with no patients,” said Dr Maher Abdallah, who operates the facility. Witnesses described a scene of chaos. Nearby residents and workers reported hearing a powerful boom, seeing a plume of smoke, and encountering debris scattered across roads. One eyewitness, Rhino Williams, said he found “only a front axle left” of a car and noticed the clinic’s front was blown out. Another, Nima Tabrizi, said it “felt like a bomb went off.” Federal and local agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), are on-site conducting a full investigation. California Governor Gavin Newsom and US Attorney General Pam Bondi have pledged full support for the probe. The incident has alarmed the Palm Springs community, a city known for its affluent residents, resorts, and medical tourism. Reproductive healthcare, including fertility treatments and abortion services, continues to be a contentious issue in the United States, with some conservative groups opposing such procedures on religious grounds."
Pakistan,Tribune,"Mexican Navy ship crashes into Brooklyn Bridge, killing two",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546490/mexican-navy-ship-crashes-into-brooklyn-bridge-19-injured,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,The cause of the incident is currently under investigation,"A Mexican Navy training vessel collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City on Saturday, killing two people and injuring 17 others, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said. The sailing ship, ARM Cuauhtémoc, was passing beneath the bridge when its tall masts struck the underside of the historic structure. The impact caused parts of the rigging to collapse and the ship to drift towards the Manhattan shoreline, where it eventually came to a stop near the Manhattan Bridge. A post shared by NBC News (@nbcnews) Videos shared on social media showed the moment the masts collided with the bridge’s lower span. Onlookers gasped as the towering rig snapped and debris fell, while crew members were seen clinging to the rigging high above the deck. New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed that emergency responders treated 19 injured individuals, with four sustaining serious injuries. He said the bridge, which dates back to 1883, had not suffered significant structural damage. “The quick response from our emergency services helped prevent a much more tragic outcome,” Adams said during a press briefing. Witnesses in Brooklyn Bridge Park described scenes of confusion and fear as the ship made impact. Sydney Neidell and Lily Katz, who were watching the sunset at the time, said they saw someone dangling from the mast after the crash. “We saw someone dangling, and I couldn’t tell if it was just blurry or my eyes,” Katz told the Associated Press. “We were able to zoom in on our phone and there was someone hanging from a harness up there for at least 15 minutes before they were rescued.” Emergency responders used smaller boats to evacuate two people from the vessel on stretchers. The Cuauhtémoc, a tall ship used as a training vessel by the Mexican Naval Academy, had been participating in an international goodwill voyage when the accident occurred. The vessel was flying a large green, white and red Mexican flag at the time of the crash. In a statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), the Mexican Navy confirmed that the ship had been damaged in a collision with the Brooklyn Bridge. It said the accident had prevented the vessel from continuing its scheduled voyage. Naval authorities, in coordination with local officials, were reviewing the condition of the crew and materials on board. Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said its ambassador to the United States and consular staff in New York were in communication with city officials and assisting the affected cadets. It did not confirm whether any Mexican personnel were among the injured. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation. Authorities have not yet determined whether a navigational error, mechanical failure or other factors played a role. The Brooklyn Bridge, a landmark of 19th-century engineering, connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn with a span of nearly 1,600 feet (490 metres). According to the New York City Department of Transportation, more than 100,000 vehicles and 32,000 pedestrians cross the bridge daily. Though shaken, officials noted that the bridge’s structural integrity remained intact. Engineers will continue to monitor the site in the days ahead. As of Sunday morning, the Cuauhtémoc remained moored near the Manhattan Bridge, surrounded by local law enforcement and maritime safety officials."
Pakistan,Tribune,Bill Gates reveals which careers AI can’t replace,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546503/bill-gates-reveals-which-careers-ai-cant-replace,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Bill Gates highlights fields where creativity and intuition still surpass AI capabilities.,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has identified three professions he believes will remain safe from being replaced by AI: biologists, energy experts, and programmers. Bill Gates said these careers rely heavily on creativity, intuition, and complex problem-solving — qualities that current AI systems cannot fully replicate. Bill Gates, who has long been at the forefront of technological innovation, acknowledged the revolutionary impact of AI but cautioned against assuming it will displace all human roles. While AI excels at processing large volumes of data and supporting decision-making, it cannot replicate the instinctive leaps in thinking often required in scientific and technical fields. “Biologists play a critical role in human development and medical discovery,” said Bill Gates. “Even with AI assistance, forming hypotheses and making conceptual breakthroughs is still a deeply human endeavour.” In addition to biologists, Bill Gates said energy professionals and programmers would continue to be in high demand. He noted that energy experts are essential in addressing the unpredictable needs of a changing global climate, while programmers are required to build, supervise, and adapt the very AI systems transforming other sectors. He also mentioned that while AI can support software development, the creation of complex or novel systems will continue to require human insight and adaptability, particularly as new platforms, threats, and global needs evolve. Bill Gates added a fourth example during a recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, joking that athletes are also likely safe from being replaced. A post shared by Naty Yifru (@natyb.yifru) “You know, like baseball — we won’t want to watch computers play baseball,” he said. “There’ll be some things we reserve for ourselves.” Despite concerns about job loss, Bill Gates remains optimistic about AI’s potential, calling it a transformative force for sectors like healthcare, education, and agriculture — if managed responsibly. However, he stressed the need for clear policies and ethical guidelines to ensure a positive impact. Bill Gates founded Microsoft in 1975, ushering in the era of personal computing. In recent years, he has become one of the most influential voices on technology’s impact on society, from pandemics to climate change to artificial intelligence."

With this win, Quetta consolidated their position at the top of the points table in the ongoing tournament. Quetta Gladiators got off to a flying start, with Khawaja Nafay hammering 51 off just 26 balls, including 5 fours and 4 towering sixes. His aggressive batting gave Quetta early momentum before he was dismissed in the 8th over. However, the momentum shifted swiftly as wickets tumbled in quick succession during the middle overs, with Shahid Aziz emerging as the standout bowler for Multan. He delivered a crucial spell, claiming 3 wickets for just 29 runs, including the key dismissals of Khawaja Nafay, Avishka Fernando, and Faheem Ashraf. At 123 for 5 in 14 overs, Multan Sultans looked in a commanding position, but Hasan Nawaz had other ideas who took the game away from the Sultans almost single-handedly. Hasan and Faheem took the score to 159, but once the all-rounder was dismissed, Nawaz took full responsibility upon himself. Even as partners kept falling at the other end, he remained composed and took the game deep. The equation came down to Quetta needing 2 runs off the final ball, and Nawaz coolly guided his side home with a composed stroke, sparking jubilant scenes in the Quetta camp. He finished with a brilliant 67 off 38 balls, smashing two fours and six sixes, as the Gladiators secured a famous win off the final ball. Earlier, Multan Sultans posted a 186-run target against Quetta Gladiators in their final league-stage match.. Opting to bat first after winning the toss, Multan got off to a quick start as Yasir Khan struck multiple boundaries in the opening over. However, captain Muhammad Rizwan was dismissed early by Faheem Ashraf, leaving the side at 12/1 in the second over. Yasir Khan, in partnership with Jahanzeib Sultan, steadied the innings with a 52-run stand before Jahanzeib was dismissed for 25. Yasir continued aggressively but was removed for 45 off 25 balls by Usman Tariq, who emerged as the most effective bowler with figures of 3/32. Tayyab Tahir contributed 36 off 24, while Aamer Azmat played a vital late cameo, remaining unbeaten on 21 off 16 balls. Shahid Aziz also added a quick 29 off 14 deliveries in the closing stages. Other wicket-takers for Quetta included Khurram Shahzad, Faheem Ashraf, Abrar Ahmed, and Mohammad Wasim Jr., each picking one wicket.

Critics argue the body has been inconsistent after Australian batter Usman Khawaja was blocked from displaying a dove symbol late in 2023 and the phrase “All lives are equal” in support of peace in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Jay Shah, the ICC Chairman and secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), publicly shared support for the Indian military — raising many to question ICC’s policy enforcement. Critics like Malcolm Conn were among the first to criticise the disparity. Conn posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account, questioning ICC's stance on both issues, whilst citing Times of India. So @Uz_Khawaja is banned by the @ICC from putting a dove on his bat supporting peace in the Middle East but @ICC chairman Jay Shah, son of India’s home affairs minister, can openly support the Indian military during conflict. Staggering hypocrisy!!! https://t.co/UDnniiNiwf The post triggered widespread debate about Shah's role in the ICC and his wider influence on world cricket. When questioned about Shah’s dual roles, Conn responded, “Had he resigned as ICC chief?” Given that world cricket is now a subsidiary of the Indian government through the son of the Home Minister being chairman of the @ICC (Jay Shah) it will always be India first. Sad irony the @ICC chairman is willing to compromise cricket’s showpiece event — https://t.co/XFEcheNRR0 Critics have pointed out that Khawaja’s peaceful message was apolitical in comparison to military endorsements, prompting further scrutiny of the ICC’s approach. How can Jay Shah, the ICC Chairman who stopped Usman Khawaja for supporting Palestine 🇵🇸, Pays tribute to Indian 🇮🇳 Armed Forces?  Pure Hypocrisy pic.twitter.com/w8fTNKUSrp While the ICC maintains a strict policy against political messaging on the field, observers argue the rules appear selectively enforced. @ICC comment on this? Sports authorities must stay neutral and irrelevant from such racism. This is not a platform of an individual to act/support their country’s armed forces on personal level and sabotage the shared stage of sports under nationalism. Jay Shah’s position as the son of India’s Home Minister Amit Shah and his high-profile involvement in both Indian cricket and the ICC has only intensified the scrutiny. Who is going to stop Jay Shah? He is chairman of ICC and have special inclination towards India.  Having Jay Shah on this position would always cause conflict of interest for many stakeholders.  It is pertinent that all boards including #PakistanCricket board should demand his… Many are now calling on the ICC to clarify its standards and apply them uniformly. So far, the ICC has not publicly addressed the controversy."
Pakistan,Tribune,Early school vacations likely,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546266/early-school-vacations-likely,"May 17, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Young students brave excessively hot weather,"Extreme hot weather has disturbed academic activities, especially for children in small private schools because of poor facilities in classrooms. The situation is alarming in the schools operating in small buildings in cities, including Lahore, which even lack adequate facilities of fans and water. Students in remote districts also suffer during the closing and mid-day hours of schools when the temperature rises. The Punjab government is likely to consider closing the educational institutions in the province because of the harsh weather and a meeting for the purpose is expected later this week. The increasing temperature during the past week made it difficult for young children to study in in the congested classrooms. The worst situation is being faced in small schools constructed in violation of rules that lack the facilities required to continue academic activities. Most of these schools are set up in about five-marla buildings that lack proper lighting, fans, water and ventilation. Parents were forced to admit their children such schools because affordability. At a time when the summer season is at its peak and a heatwave alert has been issued, the students are suffering because of lack of adequate arrangements by the school administrations to cope with the problems. The relevant authorities had issued the heatwave alert, warning that the temperature would increase across the province in coming days and advising the district administrations to remain alert and make arrangements to cope with the situation. The Punjab Schools Education Department had been informed that there was a risk of a heatwave from May 15 to 19 and advised it to make precautionary arrangements, warning that the temperature could increase by four to seven degrees Celsius. An advice had also been issued to set up heatwave counters in hospitals, while cases of heart stroke are already being reported. However, the school education department appears to have failed to persuade the institutions to make the arrangements and is left only with the option of closure of schools. When a similar situation arose last year, the education ministry closed the schools in the last week of May and started online classes. As per the academic calendar, summer holidays in schools are scheduled from June 1 till August 9."
Pakistan,Tribune,Refineries saved from further losses,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546301/refineries-saved-from-further-losses,"May 17, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Welcome steps taken to help recoup losses that will clear way for $6b investment,"New Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik has come to the rescue of oil refineries, which are facing losses of billions of rupees, in a move that will pave the way for investment of up to $6 billion in the refining sector. After becoming the petroleum minister, Malik also took measures to fully implement the facility of 35% allocation of locally explored gas to third parties. The issue had been pending for several years. The delay in implementing the Brownfield Refineries Policy 2023 had affected timelines for plant upgrade projects of the refineries, which sparked concerns among foreign investors and prevented them from making fresh investment. In the Finance Act 2024, petroleum products – motor gasoline (Mogas or petrol), high-speed diesel (HSD), kerosene oil and light diesel oil (LDO) – have been classified as ""exempt"". As a result, the refineries and oil marketing companies have to bear the cost of input sales tax (estimated at Rs34 billion for financial year 2024-25) and it cannot be recovered through product prices, which are regulated and fixed by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority. During the recent revision in oil prices, the government allowed refineries to charge Rs2.09 per litre on HSD and Rs1.09 per litre on petrol in order to recover Rs34 billion worth of losses over 12 months. The oil industry has hailed the decision and has given credit to the new petroleum minister and the petroleum secretary, who pleaded their case before the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) and the prime minister for its resolution. Attock Refinery CEO and OCAC Chairman Adil Khattak told The Express Tribune that the petroleum minister had been very helpful in resolving the loss recovery issue with full support from the petroleum secretary. However, he said the sales tax exemption matter should be permanently resolved in the upcoming budget, adding that the current decision of the government to recover the losses of refineries and the resolution of GST issue would help secure investments of $6 billion in upgrading the refining sector. Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL) was the first victim of the delay in implementation of the refinery policy because it failed to woo foreign investors for modernising its plants. It floated a tender to attract a contractor and financing for plant upgrade. The deadline for the tender was in December, but Chinese investors refused to participate until the government addressed the issues faced by the refineries. In the first tender, not a single investor participated in bidding. PRL has floated the tender for the second time, where the last date for submitting bids is May 30. However, industry officials say they are not hopeful that any investor will participate. Refineries are considered strategic national assets that play a vital role in energy security and economic development. Pakistan's refineries produce diesel in accordance with the specifications notified by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division). The import of a single HSD cargo costs approximately $45 million, which is an unnecessary burden when adequate local supplies are available. The upgrading projects will help double diesel production in the country. Over the years, the refineries have been investing in modernisation, including capacity expansions and installation of Isomerisation and Diesel Hydro Desulphurization (DHDS) units, enabling them to improve fuel specifications. Currently, Pakistan's refineries produce HSD with sulphur content ranging from Euro I to Euro V. A refinery already produces the Euro V-compliant diesel, two refineries supply Euro III fuel and the remaining produce diesel with sulphur content of around 5,000 ppm, far lower than the reported figure of 10,000 ppm."

""We urge India to adhere faithfully to its implementation,"" he told the media while addressing his weekly news conference. ""We once again appreciate the constructive role played by friendly countries in facilitating the ceasefire. We also reiterate our support for President Trump's announcement on engaging with Pakistan and India to seek a resolution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,"" the spokesperson said. ""Let me clarify: the ceasefire was achieved through the facilitation of several friendly nations. Against this backdrop, India's portrayal of Pakistan as acting out of ""despair and frustration"" is entirely baseless. The facts speak for themselves."" The spokesperson said the Directors General of Military Operations of Pakistan and India maintained periodic contact since 10 May. Both sides have agreed on a structured mechanism for phased de-escalation, he said. As a goodwill gesture, Pakistan handed over an Indian Border Security Force (BSF) constable on 14 May 2025. In return, India released a sepoy of the Pakistan Rangers. He further said at a time when the international community is actively promoting regional peace and stability, India's rhetoric reflects a persistent tendency to distort facts, justify aggression, and cast unwarranted aspersions on Pakistan's nuclear assets. In contrast, Pakistan, as a responsible state, remains committed to the ceasefire and to taking necessary steps toward de-escalation and regional stability. The spokesperson said Pakistan is a sovereign nation with resilient institutions, a committed populace, and a globally recognized role in maintaining peace and security. ""Our commitment to peace must never be mistaken for weakness. Any future aggression will also be met with full resolve. We hope India will prioritize regional stability and the well-being of its citizens over narrow, politically motivated jingoism."" He said Pakistan firmly believes in peaceful coexistence. ""We prioritise dialogue and diplomacy over conflict and confrontation. We have consistently advocated for meaningful engagement and result-oriented dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir. A just and peaceful settlement of these disputes remains indispensable for lasting peace in South Asia."" Zangnan issue Pakistan on Friday reiterated its support for China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, following Beijing's reaffirmation of its position on Zangnan, also known as Arunachal Pradesh. During his weekly press briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan stated that Pakistan ""fully supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China,"" and had noted recent reports regarding China's stance on the region. The statement comes amid renewed tensions between India and China over the disputed territory, which Beijing refers to as Zangnan. He accused New Delhi of destabilising the regional security environment with its ""aggressive posture"". Khan dismissed Indian media reports alleging nuclear radiation linked to recent border tensions as ""baseless and unfounded."" He said Pakistan's military operations under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, were a response to cross-border aggression and carried out in self-defence. ""Our response was in line with our right to self-defence [under Article 51 of the UN Charter] and aimed at preserving national sovereignty,"" Khan said. Punjab also marked a significant achievement under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with tributes and commemorative events. Khan welcomed the recent ceasefire agreement between the two sides and urged India to uphold its commitments. ""We view this as a positive step and expect India to implement the ceasefire in both letter and spirit,"" he said."

Speaking in an interview with Fox News, Trump said his intervention helped bring the two nuclear-armed neighbours back from the brink of war following a period of intense military escalation. “That was going to be a nuclear war, I think, or close… And now everyone’s happy,” Trump said, referring to tensions between the South Asian rivals. “Missiles were being fired, retaliation was underway, and both sides were escalating rapidly.” Trump credited his administration’s behind-the-scenes diplomacy for halting the crisis and said that engaging both sides through trade was part of his peace-building strategy. “I told my people, call them up—let’s start trading immediately,” he said. The president said he had ""great conversations"" with Pakistani leadership, expressing optimism about future cooperation. “They would love to trade. They are brilliant people and make incredible products. We don’t do much trading with them,” Trump said. He noted that despite positive relations, trade between the US and Pakistan remains limited. “We can’t forget them because it does take two rectangle,” he added, in what appeared to be a slip of the tongue while attempting to stress the importance of cooperation. Trump used the opportunity to criticise India’s economic policies, calling it “the country with the highest tariffs in the world.” However, he acknowledged that India had shown readiness to reduce tariffs in its trade dealings with Washington. “India… they make it almost impossible to do business,” Trump said. “Do you know that they’re willing to cut 100% of their tariffs for the United States?” Trump went on to characterise his diplomatic efforts as one of the most significant achievements of his presidency. “A bigger success than I’ll ever be given credit for,” he said. “Those are major nuclear powers. Those are not just little powers and they were angry.” Reflecting on the danger of the standoff, Trump described the escalation as dangerously close to a nuclear exchange. “It was tit for tat. It was getting deeper – more missiles. Everyone was saying ‘stronger, stronger,’ to a point where the next one’s going to be, you know what? The N word,” he said. “It’s the N word. That’s a very nasty word, right? In a lot of ways. The N word used in a nuclear sense—that’s the worst thing that can happen,” he continued. “And I think they were very close. The hatred was great.” Trump framed the episode as a case where diplomacy, combined with economic engagement, prevented a global catastrophe. “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,” he said. Concluding the interview, Trump portrayed himself as a president who delivers results. “We worked not only for world peace, but also for economic progress,” he said. “Trade is a tool for peace.” The latest escalation between Pakistan and India began on April 22, when an attack in the IIOJK resort town of Pahalgam killed 26 people. India immediately blamed Pakistan for the incident, despite providing no public evidence. In response, India undertook a series of hostile actions the next day on April 23, including suspending the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), cancelling visas for Pakistani citizens, closing the Wagah-Attari border crossing, ordering the shutdown of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi, and reducing diplomatic staff at each other's embassies. Pakistan strongly rejected the accusation, calling it unsubstantiated, but took reciprocal measures through its National Security Committee (NSC). These included halting trade with India, closing Pakistani airspace to Indian aircraft, and other countersteps. Tensions further escalated in the early hours of May 7, when missile strikes hit six cities in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), destroying a mosque and killing dozens of civilians, including women, children, and the elderly. In a swift military response, Pakistan’s armed forces shot down Indian warplanes, including three Rafale jets, widely regarded as a key asset of the Indian Air Force. Over the following two days, India launched waves of Israeli-made drones, which were also neutralised by Pakistan's military. The confrontation intensified again in the early hours of May 10, when India targeted several Pakistani airbases with missile strikes. In retaliation, Pakistan launched Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos, damaging Indian military installations, including missile storage sites, airbases, and other strategic targets. By Saturday evening, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached following intense diplomatic efforts overnight. Minutes later, the agreement was confirmed separately by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and the Indian foreign secretary. But despite the military ceasefire the war of narratives has waged on. While Pakistan publicly credited US President Donald Trump — along with China and Gulf states — for playing a vital role in defusing tensions, India downplayed foreign involvement. Indian officials insisted the truce was the result of direct bilateral talks, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal clarifying that trade was never part of discussions with US officials. Trump, however, reiterated at the US-Saudi Investment Forum that his administration had brokered the ceasefire using trade as leverage. “Let’s not trade nuclear missiles, let’s trade the things you make so beautifully,” he said, casting himself as the key peacemaker between the nuclear-armed rivals."

The move, introduced by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML‑N) MNA Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar, was brought before the House after a successful motion to suspend procedural rules. The resolution was passed without opposition, reflecting broad parliamentary support. Alongside the age limit increase, the resolution also allows candidates a total of five attempts at the CSS exam. Lawmakers urged the government to implement these changes without delay to give prospective applicants sufficient time to prepare under the revised criteria. The CSS exam serves as a key gateway to Pakistan’s elite federal services, including positions in administration, foreign affairs, customs, and other civil sectors. It has traditionally attracted fresh university graduates and young professionals, with strict eligibility criteria in terms of age and number of attempts. By raising the age cap and allowing an additional attempt, the new measures aim to broaden access and provide greater flexibility for aspirants who may need more time to prepare or who enter the workforce later."

Pakistan,Tribune,IMF narrows focus on new tax measures,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546153/imf-narrows-focus-on-new-tax-measures,"May 16, 2025",Tribune News Desk,IMF urges Pakistani authorities to listen to its experts instead of relying on the arguments about ground realities.,"The International Monetary Fund has narrowed down its focus in the new budget to mainly on additional tax measures and rebalancing the National Finance Commission award, as the government badly struggles finding any space to provide relief to the salaried class and the real estate sector. The salaried class has been hit the hardest which, according to the fresh details, paid an all-time record high Rs437 billion in income taxes in just 10 months of this fiscal year. The amount is higher by Rs150 billion compared to last year. The IMF on Thursday urged the Pakistani authorities to listen to its experts instead of relying on the arguments about ground realities or the Laffer Curve tax theory, the sources said. The Pakistani authorities mentioned low revenues due to high tax rates, which the IMF did not appreciate, they added. During a separate session, the IMF also raised questions on the working of the Federal Board of Revenue to cut taxes for the salaried class, said the government sources. They added the IMF was of the view that the proposed reduction in rates for the salaried class may result in far higher relief than claimed by the government. The FBR was now in the process of redoing the salaried class taxation slabs. The sources said that during the kick-off meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday for the budget approval, the IMF's outgoing mission Chief Nathan Porter narrowed down his mission's focus to four areas. The topmost priority of the IMF would be the revenue measures to back the Rs14.307 trillion tax target and rebalancing the distribution of fiscal resources under the NFC without affecting the constitutional scheme. The sources said that the other two areas of interest during the talks will be any savings from the downsizing of the government and the privatisation agenda in the next fiscal year. ] The provinces get 57.5% shares in the federal taxes and the government was trying to hold back some of the sums without amending the Constitution. During a meeting last week, a cabinet minister had recommended getting 50% of the additional defense spending from the provinces due to increasing requirements after India's naked hostilities against Pakistan. The IMF team virtually began discussions on the new budget from Turkey on Wednesday. The team plans to travel to Islamabad next week for the last round of talks ending on May 23rd. The sources said that during the kick-off meeting, the Pakistani authorities raised the issue of higher tax rates leading to low collection in certain areas. However, the IMF outgoing mission chief advised to listen to his experts. The IMF team seemed not impressed by the Laffer Curve economic theory. During a taxation related meeting with the FBR, the authorities shared the proposal of reducing taxes for the salaried class. The sources said that the government proposed increasing the income tax exemption threshold from Rs600,000 to Rs1.2 million per annum. It also proposed setting new slab rates of 10%, 25%, 33% and 35% while upwardly adjusting the income levels where these slabs will become effective. However, the IMF's view was that this would significantly dent the revenues. According to the fresh details, the salaried persons paid a whooping record Rs437 billion during July-April period of this fiscal year, which was Rs150 billion more than the last fiscal year. With two months remaining, the additional contribution would increase to around Rs190 billion compared to Rs75 billion that the government had claimed in June last year. The merit warrants that the salaried class burden should be lowered by at least Rs100 billion, as anything lower than would not end the discrimination with the class. The sources said that the government did not have enough fiscal space to give meaningful relief to the real estate sector. The initial proposal is to reduce the withholding taxes on the sale and purchase of the properties by only 0.5% each. The FBR wanted that after lowering the taxes, these should be treated as final liability but the Finance Minister asked to keep these adjustable. There was also a proposal to introduce a new slab of capital gains tax for the higher earnings from the property, said the sources. This week the discussions also took place within the government to reduce the sales tax on packaged milk. Some members of the FBR proposed to reduce the rate from 18% to either 15% or 17%. However, no decision was taken with one senior official suggesting to keep the rate unchanged. The 18% sales tax on packaged milk is the highest in the world despite higher malnutrition in Pakistan. While making a decision on reducing tax on milk, the FBR officials did not have a clear idea about the price of the packaged milk in the market. The tax authorities had also proposed to slap federal excise duty on biscuits but there was no agreement on that within the government. The proposal of slapping a new tax on biscuits and discussing at the level of the finance minister shows the insensitivity of the government. The sources said that the government was also considering two options with regards to the withdrawal of tax-free status of the erstwhile federally administered tribal areas. One proposal was to introduce the standard 18% rate while the second proposal was to introduce a 10% rate, said the sources. However, the final decision will be taken by the senior leadership of the PML-N, said the sources."

He said the federal budget is currently being finalised, and the Minister for Planning will be informed about the importance of the project so that appropriate allocations can be made. Minister of State for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Chaudhry Armaghan Subhani while responding to a calling attention notice over the project's exclusion from the PSDP 2024-25, he clarified that although the motorway did not make it to this year's development portfolio, he assured members that the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway (M-6) would be included in the PSDP 202526 and treated as a priority initiative under multiple funding mechanisms. He added that the Ministry of Communications has already proposed Rs10 billion for the M-6 in the next PSDP, with the figure subject to revision. ""This project will be reflected not only in the PSDP but also supported through foreign funding and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) models,"" he said adding that groundwork is underway to begin the project in the next fiscal year. He informed the house that global financial institutions, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), are interested in co-financing the motorway and that negotiations are in progress. Dismissing allegations of regional favoritism, he said the M-6 is not a Punjab-centric project, pointing out that only an 18-kilometer stretch falls in Punjab, while the rest covers Sindh and Balochistan."

Pakistan,Tribune,At least 94 killed in Gaza as Israeli airstrikes intensify ahead of planned aid rollout,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546045/at-least-94-killed-in-gaza-as-israeli-airstrikes-intensify-ahead-of-planned-aid-rollout,"May 15, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Gaza health ministry says 2,876 killed since Israel resumed airstrikes on March 18","Palestinian rescuers reported 94 people killed Thursday in Israeli strikes on blockaded Gaza, where a US-backed organisation said it intends to begin distributing aid by the end of the month. In the occupied West Bank, raids were ongoing and roads blocked after Israel’s military chief vowed to find the perpetrators of an attack that killed a pregnant Israeli woman. “Ninety-four martyrs have been killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip since dawn today,” civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Basal told AFP. The agency had given an earlier toll of 50 dead. Amir Selha, a 43-year-old Palestinian from north Gaza, reported “intense Israeli shelling all night”. “Tank shells are striking around the clock, and the area is packed with people and tents,” he said. Most Gazans have been displaced at least once during 19 months of war between Israel and Hamas. Israel blocked all aid from entering Gaza on March 2, before resuming operations on March 18 after talks to prolong a six-week ceasefire collapsed. Israel said the pressure aimed to force Hamas to free hostages in Gaza, most of them held since October 7, 2023 attack. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US-supported NGO, said it would begin distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza this month after talks with Israeli officials. Trump says US should ‘take’ Gaza and turn it into ‘freedom zone’ It said it had asked Israel to secure distribution points in northern Gaza, and that Israel had agreed. Evacuation orders The health ministry in Gaza said Thursday that 2,876 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18. It said the overall death toll in Gaza since the war broke out on October 7, 2023 stands at 53,010. The Hamas attack resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Of the 251 hostages taken during the attack, 57 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead. Selha in Gaza said army quadcopter drones dropped leaflets in his neighbourhood early Thursday, asking residents to move south. The UN estimates that 70 percent of Gaza is now either an Israeli-declared no-go zone or under evacuation order. Basal said in a statement Thursday Israel “is employing a policy of shrinking areas and emptying populated regions to pressure and terrorise civilians”. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday the military would enter Gaza “with full force” in the coming days. Despite air strikes, talks are still ongoing for a hostage release and ceasefire deal. With US President Donald Trump touring Gulf countries, his Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff discussed the hostages issue with Netanyahu on Wednesday. Hamas in a statement Thursday accused Netanyahu of undermining hostage release and ceasefire efforts “through deliberate military escalation, showing indifference to his captives, endangering their lives”. In the north of the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, Israel’s army chief said a manhunt was under way after an attack that killed a pregnant woman. Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said at the site of the attack: “We will use all the tools at our disposal and reach the murderers in order to hold them accountable.” The woman, an Israeli settler who was on her way to give birth, was pronounced dead early Thursday. Her baby was saved after delivery by caesarean section, according to the Tel Aviv hospital where she was taken. Calls for revenge Israel’s military said in a statement Thursday that “both a physical and intelligence-based search” for the attacker was under way. Users of Palestinian Telegram channels sharing information on West Bank checkpoints on Thursday reported many road closures in the territory’s north. WhatsApp groups for Israeli settlers in the West Bank were rife with calls for vengeance in retaliation for the attack. “To make sure this never happens again.. we need real revenge! Erase every terror village, and every village that stays silent in the face of the murder of Jews,” one user wrote. In the northern West Bank town of Tammun, meanwhile, an army raid early Thursday killed four Palestinians, the former mayor said. Najeh Bani Odeh said he had been informed via a Palestinian-Israeli coordination channel that four fighters had been killed. The army did not confirm the raid to AFP. Bani Odeh said soldiers entered Tammun at 7am and surrounded a house in which “there were between four and five gunmen”. “We do not know what happened yet because the army is still present, but residents in the area said the army entered the house and that the young men were martyred inside,” Bani Odeh told AFP."
Pakistan,Tribune,Indo-Pak war 2025: Pakistan has the last laugh,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2545538/indo-pak-war-2025-pakistan-has-the-last-laugh,"May 13, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Retaliatory strikes targeted not just troop concentrations and air assets, but the very spine of operational command","In the early hours following India's unprovoked attack, Pakistan's Armed Forces launched a calibrated response - code-named Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - one that not only neutralised incoming threats and gripped the world's attention instantly, but also sent a clear message to New Delhi the skies above Pakistan would not be ceded to aggression or violations of national sovereignty. What unfolded was not just a military response, but a moment of rare operational clarity - drones intercepted, air dominance reasserted, and command over the slaloming narrative of victory, being spun by India's media apparatus loyal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reclaimed with measured confidence - all in one fell swoop, under the banner of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. Behind the scenes, coordination between the Pakistan Air Force, Army, and Navy ensured the response was not only proportional, but tactically above India's capabilities. The military's top brass, appearing in a rare tri-services media briefing, conveyed calm precision - a sharp contrast to their visibly tense Indian counterparts, who, hours later, struggled to account for the precise outcome in both numbers and detail before a press corps that had largely toed the government's narrative throughout the escalation - one triggered by a barrage of Indian missiles and breaches, but concluded by Pakistan's response. For Pakistan, what began as a military counter quickly transformed into a full-spectrum show of force. Its retaliatory strikes targeted not just Indian troop concentrations and air assets, but the very spine of India's operational command - from missile silos to drone fleets, air defence shields to digital firewalls. In a tightly coordinated air offensive, Pakistan neutralized 26 high-value military installations across five Indian states, leaving behind what experts have described as structural wreckage and tactical disarray for their opponent. At Beas and Nagrota - sites used to launch attacks on Pakistan that killed over 30 people - BrahMos storage facilities were reduced to ashes. In Udhampur, security officials from Pakistan revealed, India's prized S-400 air defence systems - the crown jewel of its aerial shield - were obliterated in minutes. Pathankot Airbase, long considered a frontline launchpad, they confirmed, was rendered inoperative, its runways crumpled and hangars charred. The logistics hub in Jalandhar came under sustained precision fire, triggering secondary explosions and cutting off crucial supply chains. According to officials, by the time Pakistan's strikes reached Nagrota, Akhnoor and Uri, the writing was on the wall of India – not only would aggression be met with force, but its military calculus had evolved - leaner, faster, and digitally lethal. Assault on Srinagar's Northern Command HQ - which left over 21 confirmed dead, officials said, sent shockwaves through India's northern military belt. Chandigarh's weapons depot and communications grid were similarly compromised, as was the airfield at Suratgarh, pushing Indian Air Force operations into retreat. Even India's prized Rafale jets - long sold to the world as emblems of assured air supremacy - failed to turn the tide. According to multiple foreign media outlets, including CNN, three of these jets were shot down across the Sialkot, Lahore and Kashmir sectors. As Operation Bunyanum Marsoos continued, it also chipped away at the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) official narrative, stirring unease within Prime Minister Modi's inner circle. Meanwhile, news of destruction from Pakistan’s retaliation spread widely, prompting authorities to block over 8,000 social media accounts, including BBC Urdu, by executive order.  Speaking to Al Jazeera about the damage caused by Pakistan's retaliatory strikes, Shashank Joshi, defence editor at The Economist, noted that it is ""entirely possible"" India underestimated the advancement of Pakistan's Chinese-made missiles. But that 'damage' extended far beyond visible borders. In a deep-penetration drone campaign, Pakistan's UAVs dotted and crossed targets from Uri to Pokhran, from Amritsar to Barmer - searing through logistics corridors, fuel dumps, and communications outposts. Over 90 Indian drones, security officials said, were neutralized. Even the airspace near the Delhi National Capital Region wasn't spared during the operation. At the same time, a silent war was waged in cyberspace. Pakistan disabled ten SCADA networks, crippling 70 per cent of the Northern energy grid. Indian Railways' digital infrastructure, details gathered later, showed a total collapse. Gas supplies to Delhi and Kashmir were cut off. Information released by Pakistani officials confirms that key Indian government databases, surveillance systems, and at least three national media networks were severely compromised - with Aadhaar systems, the Indian Air Force network, and even the Maharashtra Election Commission among confirmed targets. In total, over 2,500 surveillance nodes were breached. Data reveals that dozens of web portals - including those of the ruling BJP and defence manufacturers - were either defaced or erased entirely. Addressing a media briefing to announce the successful conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR), Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said that Pakistan had vowed justice and retribution for the reprehensible Indian aggression and killings of its citizens. ""Alhamdulillah! Pakistan Armed Forces have delivered the promise made to our people."""
Pakistan,Tribune,How indigenous technology helped PAF down Rafale,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2545964/how-indigenous-technology-helped-paf-down-rafale,"May 15, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Extraordinary feat sends shockwaves across the globe,"Chinese-made fighter jets may have stolen the limelight after Pakistan Air Force (PAF) shot down six Indian fighter jets, including highly-advanced French made Rafalebut that extraordinary feat was not possible without a critical indigenous technology that sent shockwaves across the globe. ""Our Chinese friends even want to know the operational details. How we did it,"" said a source privy to the development. When India inducted Rafale jets into its air force, Pakistan lost the ""first shot"" capability and the PAF was cognizant of the fact. The Operation Swift Retort in February 2019 in response to India's Balakot strikes was perhaps the last conventional battle and dogfight. Even at that time PAF showed glimpses of its prowess in the electromagnetic sphere when it jammed Indian Mig-21, making it difficult to escape the kill. But still the PAF was far from possessing the technology to excel in multi domain. The induction of J10-C was Pakistan's response to India's Rafael but that was not enough. The paradigm shift came after Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar took charge of the PAF in March 2021. He had envisioned that the future wars would no longer be conventional and hence he had started working on the idea of multi domain. A ""multi-domain"" refers to operations that integrate and synchronise capabilities across multiple warfare domains to achieve mission objectives. The key domains are: traditional aircraft-based operations, ii) land – coordination with ground forces, iii) sea – involving naval power, iv) space – satellites, missile warning, navigation (GPS), and communications, v) cyber – digital warfare, including network defense and offensive cyber operations, vi) Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) – jamming, electronic warfare, and signal disruption. The PAF multi-domain operation encompasses real-time imagery, cyber units disabling enemy radar, drones providing surveillance and fighter jets launching precision strikes. ""All while being coordinated through secure, networked communications,"" said the source. ""In the modern warfare you may have many toys but there is no use of those toys if they don't talk to each other,"" according to the source. For example, Pakistan has acquired radars from different countries. Integration of those technologies that have different origins was an uphill task. The source said what the PAF did was that it developed an indigenous Data Link that integrated all these systems. Under the modernisation plan, the PAF established the PAF Cyber Command (PAFCC) and the PAF Space Command (PAFSC) in Islamabad. The PAF also created the NASTP (National Aerospace Science & Technology Park) which has become a hub for various indigenous programs. On the night of April 28 and 29, the PAF high command was on high alert. At the Command Operation Center (COC), the integrated system was put to test for the first time in real war theater, although the PAF did multiple war games to check its efficacy. After midnight, the system immediately spotted four Rafale jets when they took off and flew over the Indian-Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The air chief and his team were watching the movements of planes live. The PAF jets were airborne within no time and Pakistan managed to jam some of the systems of the Rafale, forcing the Indian jets to flee. The potential hostile act was thwarted. All Indian fighter jets including 14 Rafale when they took off on the night of 6 and 7 May to launch a series of missile strikes inside Pakistan were immediately spotted through electronic IDs. As many as 72 Indian fighter jets were airborne and deep inside in their territory. Yet, the Pakistani side could see and track their movements. As per the rules of engagements given to Pakistani pilots, Indian fighter jets would only be shot at if they released any weapon. The moment they fired missiles inside Pakistan, the rules of engagements changed midair and PAF pilots were asked to shoot them down. Due to integrated Data link, Pakistani pilots had a clear visibility and necessary ground support enabling them to hit the target bulls' eye. This was for the first time Rafale was shot down in a combat action. This was also the first time Chinese and western technologies were tested on the battlefield and China came out on top. While China-Pakistan close cooperation played a key role, the importance of indigenous system developed by PAF over the last few years cannot be ignored, according to sources. ""Losing six fighter jets in a battle is a massive blow to the Indian Air Force,"" said a PAF officer, who added while the nation cherished the victory they were preparing for the next challenge."

Pakistan,Tribune,"To feed its delusions of grandeur, India will fight",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2545873/to-feed-its-delusions-of-grandeur-india-will-fight,"May 15, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Some analysts are making the case that the days ahead are more dangerous than May 9 and May 10,"Some of the few people I knew as a college student who had read some books outside of the textbooks used to say that the army of Pakistan is deliberately causing the continued enmity with India in order to justify their defence budget. Seemed plausible at the time because for one, it was the first time I had heard of an argument outside of the boring textbooks and two, it just felt good to be rebellious in an intellectual way. Things, however, are not as simple. Quite honestly, I would love to see the Pakistan Army act recklessly with India because that is the language this Hindutva society understands. And I use the word society because I do not buy into that nonsense where people make the case that it is rather their Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and his RSS-driven party that subscribe to and practise the extremist ideology. The fact that an overwhelming majority of the Indian people voted for this known terrorist speaks volumes about the mindset of the entire society. Some analysts are making the case that the days ahead are more dangerous than May 9 and May 10. And I agree with that because when Modi's pilot Abhinandan was captured and given that fantastic tea, Modi went berserk and abrogated article 370, which had granted a special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. This time around, Modi's India has gotten a bloody nose from Pakistan, its ego bruised, its status as a global hegemon thrashed, its image as a reliable and responsible player in the region completely destroyed. India is now acting like a mad dog that has been beaten badly and is now licking its wounds. Modi has every incentive to start a reckless war with Pakistan again in order to regain his lost respect among the general masses. The Rafale and the S-400, of which India was so proud, were both literally burnt to the ground within a matter of hours, if not minutes. The most interesting thing is that just like Israel was recruited back in the late 60s as the reliable American cop on the beat in the local region, India had been enlisted for the same purpose only with a specific target: China. It just reminded me of a funny story we liked to tell in childhood. There was a neighbour who had a big and mean dog. The owner fed him with paratha and keema and all kinds of other healthy diet in order to keep the dog mean and strong so that the day when the thieves would come with the intention of robbing the owner in his house, the dog would not only alert him to the presence of hostile company but also fight back. Eventually, that day did come and the robbers faced off with the mean and large dog. The robbers kicked the dog just once and the dog started running and crying for help from its owner, whom the dog was supposed to buffer from the very robbers. The raison d'etre of the dog and his high maintenance lifestyle was to prevent the thieves from gaining entry into the house where they would finally challenge the owner. The United States, Europe and Quad member states are in no different position today than the one the owner of the dog found himself in. India was fed and supported so as to groom it to face off with China and help contain that silent superpower, so that China may never be able to rise up to challenge America. Far from challenging China, India got slapped in the face very badly by China's local cop on the beat: Pakistan. In a blink of an eye, India managed to insult not only itself but also the manufacturers of Rafale and S-400. In just one night, Modi managed to disappoint not only his hypocritical global backers but also his own fellow citizens who were lied to day and night about how they had already defeated Pakistan."

The two initially formed a strong bond during their time on Celebrity Big Brother last month, with Siwa referring to the former Love Island contestant, 32, as her “platonic soulmate.” Since leaving the reality show, the pair have continued to maintain a close connection, often sharing their interactions online.  On Sunday, Hughes confirmed their reunion by posting a cozy photo of the pair in Mexico City on Snapchat, writing “Finally reunited.” Hughes flew 12 hours to join Siwa, who is performing at the Tecate Emblema Festival before celebrating her birthday on Monday. Following their stint in the Big Brother house, Siwa and Hughes stayed in contact through frequent FaceTime calls and social media posts. Last week, Siwa shared a series of images on Instagram that highlighted their friendship, including a photo of them hugging and another during a video call. She also posted a video of herself rehearsing their Dirty Dancing-inspired routine, playfully noting that Hughes hadn’t shown up for practice yet. While fans continue to speculate about a possible romance, Siwa emphasized during a recent Stanford speaking engagement that their bond is unique and meaningful. She described Hughes as a “vital part of [her] life” and called him “a really incredible, sweet man.” Though she stopped short of confirming a relationship, she added, “He’s a keeper, we’ll keep him around, we’ll see.” As Siwa prepares for her upcoming UK performances later this month, her deep friendship with Hughes continues to capture public attention."
Pakistan,Tribune,External loan options limited: IMF,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546448/external-loan-options-limited-imf,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Pakistan needs over $19b to bear foreign debt cost, bridge deficit in FY26","Pakistan will need over $19 billion to service its foreign debt and finance the external deficit in the next fiscal year as the country's access to foreign commercial loans and budget support will remain limited, a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) report stated on Saturday. The IMF's staff-level report said that Pakistan's economy would be impacted by the United States' tariffs. The report has been released a week after the global lender approved the second loan tranche of $1 billion for Islamabad and cleared the new $1.3 billion climate financing package. The report showed that for fiscal year 2025-26, starting from July, Pakistan's gross external financing need would be $19.3 billion. Out of this, nearly $17 billion is available in the shape of new loans and rollovers of the existing debt. It identified a $2.4 billion gap against which the country was securing commitments from foreign creditors. The $19.3 billion financing includes $1.5 billion for the current account deficit and the remaining for repaying the foreign debt. However, some of the traditional funding sources are either drying up or will not be available. Against Pakistan's desire to get an annual $1.2 billion under the Saudi oil facility, the IMF has estimated the available financing at $800 million for the next fiscal year. Another $410 million will come under the new IMF package, called the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), according to the IMF. But the lender has estimated the receipt of only $400 million on account of sovereign bonds — that too from China. It has shown just $85 million in new net borrowing from foreign commercial banks, indicating that the global markets are still not accessible. ""Access to external commercial financing is expected to remain limited during the programme, with a small ""Panda"" bond issuance anticipated in fiscal year 2025-26, ahead of a gradual return to the Eurobond market assumed in FY27,"" it added. The IMF said that Pakistan's public debt remained sustainable over the medium term. But it added that the continuation of fiscal consolidation and progress with lengthening maturities of domestic debt, near-term risks of sovereign stress remain high, reflecting Pakistan's very large gross financing needs and past challenges in obtaining external financing. Another worrisome element for the government was that the IMF did not show any budget support loan from the World Bank in the next fiscal year too. The Express Tribune had reported a few months ago that the World Bank had stopped Pakistan's budget financing. The IMF has shown only $250 million worth of budget support financing by the Asian Development Bank. It has lowered the current account deficit projection for this fiscal year to just $229 million against its original estimate of $3.6 billion. The IMF said that the deficit would remain low due to resilient exports and a stronger remittance outlook, as improved macro and foreign exchange stability supported a rebound in remittance inflows through formal channels. Over the medium term, the IMF said that Pakistan's current account deficit is expected to widen modestly to around 1% of GDP as imports rebound. Gross international reserves are expected to continue to strengthen, supported by financing committed by multilateral and bilateral creditors, as well as prospective RSF disbursements. While commenting on the US tariff policy's impact, the IMF said that uncertainties around the impact of recent tariff announcements on Pakistan's economic and financial conditions are significant, with risks skewed to the downside. While there is considerable uncertainty about the final impact on the economy, the tariffs and subsequent financial market reaction are expected to weigh on Pakistan's exports and GDP, with growth revised downward marginally in FY25, said the IMF. In addition to the direct impact on Pakistan's exports to the US, Pakistan is expected to face indirect effects via the impact of tariffs on the economies of Pakistan's other trading partners, tighter global financial conditions, potentially lower remittances and increased trade policy uncertainty, according to the report. But the net impact on balance of payments is projected to be moderated by the recent commodity price declines and the downgrade in activity, which will reduce Pakistan's import bill. The IMF said that Pakistan's sovereign spreads have increased sharply since April 2, the day the US introduced new tariffs, but market access to external financing in the near term is already limited, vitiating any near-term impact. The IMF said that if outflow pressures intensify, it will be critical that the exchange rate is allowed to adjust. The net impact on inflation is also projected to be modest, with some downward pressure expected from lower commodity prices and weaker growth, stated the report. The IMF said that Pakistan's capacity to repay the fund has improved somewhat but remains subject to significant downside risks and critically dependent on policy implementation and timely external financing. The IMF's lending would peak at about $13 billion in September 2027, which will be equal to 466% of the quota and about 51% of projected gross foreign exchange reserves in 2027. The report underlined that geopolitically driven increases in commodity prices, tightening in global financial conditions, weakening of remittances, or higher trade barriers in other trading partners could adversely affect Pakistan's external stability. The other main immediate risk relates to policy slippages given pressures to ease policies and provide tax and other concessions and subsidies to connected interests, it added. ""An intensification of political or social tensions could also weigh on policy and reform implementation""."
Pakistan,Tribune,OpenAI launches Codex for software engineers,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546366/openai-launches-codex-for-software-engineers,"May 17, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Codex now accessible to users subscribed to ChatGPT Pro, Team, or Enterprise plans.","OpenAI has launched a research preview of Codex, its most advanced AI coding agent to date, marking a significant expansion of the company’s capabilities in AI-powered software engineering. Announced on May 16, 2025, Codex is now available to subscribers of ChatGPT Pro, Team, and Enterprise, with plans to expand access to ChatGPT Plus and Edu users in the coming weeks. Powered by Codex-1, a fine-tuned version of OpenAI’s o3 reasoning model, Codex is designed specifically for software engineering tasks. According to OpenAI, Codex-1 produces “cleaner” code, follows instructions more precisely, and can autonomously test and debug until successful results are achieved. Unlike previous autocomplete-style models, the new Codex functions as a cloud-based agent capable of running multiple tasks in parallel over longer periods. Codex operates in a secure, sandboxed virtual environment and integrates directly with GitHub, allowing it to preload and interact with a user’s codebase. Tasks such as writing new features, fixing bugs, answering code-specific questions, and generating pull requests can all be performed with minimal user intervention. The AI agent can operate autonomously from one to 30 minutes, depending on task complexity, without restricting access to the user’s computer or browser. OpenAI’s Agents Research Lead Josh Tobin described the new Codex as a step toward building AI systems that act like “virtual coworkers,” collaborating on complex engineering tasks instead of just providing short-form answers. “Our vision is that ChatGPT becomes a true engineering assistant—handling hours or days of work independently,” Tobin said during a product briefing. Users can assign tasks to Codex directly from ChatGPT’s interface by entering a prompt and selecting the “Code” option. They can also ask questions about specific code files by clicking the “Ask” button. Below the prompt bar, users can track all active and completed tasks, offering transparency into Codex’s progress and decision-making. OpenAI is also rolling out updates to Codex CLI, its open-source coding agent that runs in developers’ terminals. The tool now uses the o4-mini model, optimised for coding tasks, and is available through the OpenAI API at a rate of $1.50 per 1 million input tokens and $6 per 1 million output tokens. In terms of safety, OpenAI says Codex has been designed to refuse requests to build malicious software and operates in an air-gapped environment with no internet or external API access, reducing the risk of misuse. Despite these protections, the company acknowledges that AI coding systems still make mistakes, citing a Microsoft study showing even leading models struggle with consistent software debugging. The launch comes amid surging demand for AI-powered developer tools, with major tech firms and startups vying for dominance in the space. Competitors such as Anthropic’s Claude Code, Google’s Gemini Code Assist, and tools like Cursor and Windsurf are seeing rapid growth. Cursor reportedly reached an annualised revenue of $300 million and is seeking funding at a $9 billion valuation. Notably, OpenAI is rumoured to have acquired Windsurf, a rival coding platform, for $3 billion—a move seen as both a consolidation strategy and a signal of OpenAI’s ambition in the software engineering domain. Codex’s launch is part of a broader effort to transform ChatGPT into a multi-functional AI platform. Alongside Codex, OpenAI has recently added new agents such as Sora for video, Deep Research, and Operator for web browsing—benefits now bundled with ChatGPT’s subscription tiers. With the debut of Codex, OpenAI aims to position itself as a dominant force in the next generation of developer tools, where AI agents work not just as assistants but as fully capable coding collaborators"
Pakistan,Tribune,Is Cena's heel run a bust?,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546441/is-cenas-heel-run-a-bust,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Two months into the historic turn, it's already lost steam","On March 2, John Cena did the unthinkable and turned heel after more than two decades. He turned on Cody Rhodes and sold his soul to The Rock. In what's his last year as a wrestler, he defeated Rhodes at WrestleMania 41 to make history again and win his 17th world championship, breaking Ric Flair's record. At WWE Backlash, Cena defeated his old rival Randy Orton in what was possibly their last one-on-one match to retain the title. When the turn occurred, it was compared to Hulk Hogan joining the NWO as to how industry-changing it had the potential to be. However, despite all the right elements, the weight that Cena's name, accolades and the gravity this historic achievement carries, the heel run so far hasn't lived up to the hype it had on paper. A number of issues have accumulated and left the fans underwhelmed with the run since March. But the biggest issue with Cena's heel turn might not even be Cena himself. Ruining wrestling In his first promo after the heel turn, Cena said he wanted to ""ruin wrestling"" and turned on the fans since they never respected him even when he was a good guy. That is a fact. The fans turned on him soon into his Super Cena days as most other fan-favourite stars didn't get their due recognition and opportunities in the company due to him being at the top. It frustrated the fans for years. After a significant time away, fans have come to appreciate Cena again but that wasn't always the case. Therefore, when he turned heel months away from his in-ring retirement, fans were elated. But Cena's logic and motivation left a lot to be desired. Performing as a heel doesn't just mean wearing a boo-boo face and blaming the fans. A heel persona is relatively easier than being a babyface since it allows wrestlers to be more interesting characters. When in a rut, they even demand to turn heel so they could save their careers. And it has worked countless times, including with Cena in early 2000s. Cena doesn't need to save his career at this point. He has done it all many times over. And yet the entirety of his heel persona can be summed up in a frown and the typical ""all you people"" lines sprinkled with one-liners right out of a fraudulent motivational speaker's speech. It cannot be possible that Cena has forgotten how to be a heel. He used to be a fantastic one before he became the top guy. The Doctor of Thuganomics persona still lives in fans' hearts even after two decades as that's what catapulted him to superstardom. Wearing a chain and lock, and rapping and dissing his opponents made the crowd love him. But now, the only way you can tell Cena is the bad guy is because he doesn't smile anymore and keeps a permanent frown on his face. In his promos, Cena keeps repeating he will retire with the championship and ruin wrestling and that he's the last real champion. But why does he want to ruin wrestling when he's the one who has reigned at the top for about 20 years? A heel turn of such magnitude should have a stronger motivation behind it. The run is also undermined by Cena's lack of weekly scheduled dates. The weeks-long wait between each appearance also leaves fans dissatisfied since upon each return, they are offered similar ambiguous promos with no answers. No Final Boss The motivation of the turn was teased when it happened. This is why perhaps the fans' dissatisfaction with Cena's heel run isn't entirely due to Cena himself, but The Rock. Dwayne Johnson's Final Boss persona was the best thing in wrestling during the buildup to WrestleMania 40 last year. The fans expected a follow-up this year due to his involvement with Rhodes. He appeared and offered the champ to sell his soul. When Rhodes refused, Cena accepted and the two former rivals beat Rhodes to a bloody pulp (along with a stiff shot from rapper Travis Scott that resulted in a broken eardrum and a black eye). However, in the last two months, The Rock disappeared and has had no involvement in this story that he kickstarted. In fact, even Cena and Rhodes have barely mentioned the Final Boss, leaving fans with unanswered questions. During a podcast appearance, The Rock said he felt the character did his job and he stepped out of the spotlight to put more focus on Cena and Rhodes who were to main event WrestleMania for the title. Even during the match, only Scott appeared to interfere and help Cena, rather than The Rock himself. But the Final Boss character is needed back to answer the questions about why he and Cena joined forces. What did he offer to Cena that he sold his soul to him? Why did he want Cody in the first place? And what did The Rock give Cody last year after WrestleMania? And what's next now that Cena has got the world title? In over two months, there has been no progression in the story. WWE has only been offering random side quests for Cena to keep the reign. It's essentially a failed magic trick, where a rabbit doesn't pop out of a hat, so you distract the audience with card and number tricks, and claim that was the plan all along. But WWE hasn't convinced anyone yet that this was always the plan. Of course, this is easily fixable if The Rock returns and they provide some answers. But so far, it just seems like a pointless move. When Cena turned, he had already won the Elimination Chamber match and had a guaranteed title shot. He didn't need The Rock's help. So, now the payoff, if or when it comes, has to be much bigger than that to do justice to the story. According to reports, The Rock (who's a member of the board of directors at TKO Group, which owns WWE) wanted Rhodes to turn heel, but WWE refused, considering his popularity. The next best option was Cena. The Rock played along at first and then left them hanging to figure it out themselves. Whether there is any truth to these reports by the dirtsheets and wrestling journalists is irrelevant at this point. Such speculations will naturally spread among the fans when the story is flawed and character motivations aren't clear. Rest assured, WWE must tie up the loose threads and make sense of this heel run before the fans stop caring about bad man Cena, which has already started happening with the increasing cheers for the Hollywood star."
Pakistan,Tribune,Basmati exports plunge,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546450/basmati-exports-plunge,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Fall to 43,895 tons primarily due to closure of Iran border","Pakistan's Basmati rice exports plummeted to a low of 43,895 tons in April 2025, marking the worst monthly performance in the current fiscal year (July 2024-April 2025), according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). The sharp decline came despite a strong export surge earlier in the year, including a magical figure of 100,780 tons achieved in February 2025, a month with only 28 days. Hamid Malik, a commodities' expert, attributed April's slump primarily to the closure of Iran border during the month, a critical route for Pakistan's Basmati, though he noted that exports to Iran rebounded at a brisk pace in May. Overall, Basmati exports for the first 10 months of FY25 stood at 707,875 tons, a 15% jump from 612,126 tons during the same period of last year. However, non-Basmati exports dipped slightly to 4,390,333 tons (from 4,474,855 tons in FY24), with Malik warning of a potential 3-4% annual decline due to stiff competition from India, which is flooding African markets with cheaper rice. Total rice exports for the 10-month period remained nearly flat at 5.08 million tons, reflecting mixed trends. Further complicating trade, shipments faced delays in late April due to protests on the Indus Highway by the Sindh nationalist groups demanding better water distribution. The blockade disrupted truck movements for days, creating backlogs at Karachi Port. While the protests have subsided, exporters fear recurring disruptions, primarily due to Pak-India tensions that could dent Pakistan's reputation as a reliable supplier. Malik projected Basmati exports would finish the fiscal year stronger than last year, citing Iran's resumed imports and steady demand from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. However, Jahandad Khan, an agricultural economist, cautioned that Pakistan's non-Basmati sector risks losing long-term market share unless it addresses structural issues like high production costs and outdated farming techniques. He urged investment in climate-resilient crops to counter India's pricing advantage. Meanwhile, logistics analyst Ali Raza highlighted Pakistan's growing reliance on air freight for premium Basmati shipments to Europe and the US, saying that quality-conscious buyers are willing to pay more, but shipping delays via road or sea remain a hurdle. Pakistan ranks among the world's top rice exporters, renowned for its aromatic Basmati and affordable non-Basmati varieties. Key markets include Iran, China, East Africa and the Middle East. While India remains its fiercest competitor in non-Basmati trade, Pakistan's Basmati holds a niche due to its distinct quality. Still, Malik stressed the need for better trade diplomacy and infrastructure upgrades to sustain growth amid geopolitical and climate challenges. As the fiscal year closes, stakeholders remain watchful of monsoon forecasts and global price shifts, factors that could define Pakistan's rice trade fortunes in 2026."

""You condemned the attack but never named the attacker,"" she wrote. ""You benefited from this country's pride and brands, now you're playing the victim card? That's not how loyalty works."" Hina added that neutrality on the matter might be individually beneficial but not when it comes to one's nation. ""In this case, you lose respect on both sides, which is pretty visible given how the citizens of your own country were banned, humiliated, and asked to leave within 48 hours. Kids and soldiers lost their lives. God! Drop the victim card,"" she said. The actor-host commented her thoughts under a post about Fawad's wife, Sadaf Fawad, who shared a written piece supporting the Humsafar star through patriotic loyalty tests during the fragile situation, given Fawad's multiple acting credits in Bollywood. The piece also sparked conversations across social media, with other celebrities also chiming in. Durefishan Saleem shared it on Instagram Stories, quoting a part of the text, ""Turning patriotism into a popularity contest and bullying your own is the problem."" Earlier, Fawad broke his silence on the conflict between the two nations following India's attack which claimed civilian lives in Pakistan. ""My deepest condolences to the families of those injured and killed in this shameful attack. I pray for the souls of the deceased and strength for their loved ones in the days to come,"" The Legend of Maula Jatt actor wrote on Instagram Stories. He added, ""A respectful request to all: stop stoking the flames with rabble-rousing words. It is not worth the lives of innocent people. May better sense prevail. Insha'Allah. Pakistan Zindabad."" Fawad's take encountered mixed responses from netizens. While some lauded him for speaking up in tandem with his peers, others deemed his stance too diplomatic against India's aggression. ""Why didn't you condemn India?"" a user outright questioned, while another wrote, ""He's still trying to save his career in the Indian film industry."" Some also said his response was ""too late"" and hence felt performative. ""This was needed way earlier,"" a user said. ""Stop saving face."" Surrounding the escalation of conflict, India also imposed a nationwide ban on the social media accounts of Pakistani celebrities, as well as removing them from film posters, music video thumbnails, and singing credits. Caught in this virtual crossfire were all Pakistani stars who had worked on the other side of the border, including Fawad, Mahira Khan, and Atif Aslam."

The petition, signed by more than 370 actors and filmmakers, also denounced Israel's killing of Fatima Hassouna, the young Gaza photojournalist featured in the documentary Put Your Soul in Your Hand and Walk, which premiered at the Cannes film festival on Thursday. The organisers of the letter said the French actor Juliette Binoche, who is chairing the jury at Cannes, also added her name to the letter, along with Rooney Mara, US indie director Jim Jarmusch and Lupin star Omar Sy. Binoche had initially seemed to pull back from supporting it as the festival opened on Tuesday, instead delivering a tribute to Hassouna, who was killed with 10 members of her family the day after she learned the film would be shown at Cannes. ""She should have been here tonight with us,"" an emotional Binoche said at the opening ceremony. The growing protest comes after several days of mounting bloodshed in the besieged Palestinian territory, with 120 people killed on Thursday and 50 reported dead since midnight. Schindler's List star Ralph Fiennes as well as Richard Gere, Mark Ruffalo, Guy Pearce, Susan Sarandon, Javier Bardem, and directors David Cronenberg, Pedro Almodovar, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Leigh said they were ""ashamed"" of their industry's failure to speak out about Israel's siege of Gaza in the original letter. In her Cannes speech on Tuesday, Binoche also referenced the Israeli hostages taken on October 7, 2023.

Pakistan,Tribune,PSX wraps up bullish week near 120k,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546456/psx-wraps-up-bullish-week-near-120k,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Benchmark KSE-100 index soars 11.6% — the highest in five years,"The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a historic rally in the outgoing week, with the KSE-100 index surging by a record 10,123 points (+9.45%) in a single day, hitting the upper circuit breaker on Monday and closing the week at an all-time high of 119,649 points – a weekly gain of 11.6%, the highest in five years. The rally was fueled by a confluence of powerful triggers, including a US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan, fresh IMF inflows totaling $2.4 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), and a current account surplus of $1.88 billion in 10MFY25. On a day-on-day basis, as tensions began to ease, the PSX experienced a skyrocketing start to the week. On Monday, it recorded a historic rise of over 10,000 points, achieving the highest single-day close ever. The index ended the day at 117,298, having gained 10,123 points, or 9.45%. On the second day, the bull-run continued as the KSE-100 index extended its gains by penetrating the 118,000 level and closed the day up 1,278 points, taking cumulative gains since Friday's opening to over 14.5%, or 15,050 points. However, on Wednesday, trading activity remained volatile and closed slightly lower as a mix of investor optimism and caution prevailed. At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index posted a marginal loss of 39 points. On Thursday, the PSX roared back to life as the index soared 1,425 points, or 1.20%, not only recouping the previous day's thin loss but also closing at an all-time high. The bourse ended the week lower, when it dropped 313 points after a range-bound session. Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its weekly review, wrote that the KSE-100 index took a sharp turn and skyrocketed into the green zone on Monday, hitting the upper cap of the circuit breaker. The index posted a historic gain of 10,123 points (+9.45%) – the highest ever in both absolute and percentage terms. The rally followed a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, brokered by the US, who also expressed the intention to enhance trade ties with both countries. In addition, Pakistan secured IMF's approval for $1 billion under the EFF and $1.4 billion under the RSF, it said. On the macro front, the current account recorded a surplus of $1,880 million in 10MFY25. The large-scale manufacturing (LSM) output grew 1.79% year-on-year (YoY) in March 2025. In the T-bill auction (first post-monetary policy), the SBP raised Rs664 billion vs target of Rs550 billion, while yields dropped sharply by 66-90 basis points (bps) across all tenors. Additionally, the MSCI added three Pakistani companies to the Frontier Markets (FM) Index and four to the FM Small-cap Index. All these indicators reflected a strong positive momentum, driving the KSE-100 past the 119k level to close at a new all-time high on Thursday, AHL said. The SBP's reserves rose $71 million to $10.4 billion. Overall, the PSX was the best-performing market on a week-on-week (WoW) basis, posting its highest gain in five years, and closed at 119,649 points (+11.6% WoW). Sector-wise, positive contributions came from banks (2,711 points), E&P (1,937 points), fertiliser (1,338 points), cement (1,249 points) and tech (666 points). Stock-wise, positive contributors were UBL (922 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (876 points), Pakistan Petroleum (750 points), OGDC (581 points) and Lucky Cement (519 points). Foreigners' selling was witnessed during the week, which came in at $9.13 million compared to net buying of $1.52 million last week. Major selling was witnessed in E&P companies ($5.98 million). Average volumes arrived at 685 million shares (up 34.8% WoW) while average value stood at $144.2 million (up 47.1%). JS Global analyst Abdul Basit wrote that Pakistan had initiated virtual technical-level discussions with the IMF on the upcoming FY26 budget, with formal policy-level negotiations to commence next week. The government has approved the phased privatisation of 24 companies, including PIA. As per PBS data, the LSM index recorded a 1.8% YoY increase in March, marking a return to positive growth after four consecutive months of decline. In the recently held T-bill auction, the SBP raised Rs664 billion against the target of Rs550 billion, with yields dropping 66 to 90 bps across different maturities, he said."
Pakistan,Tribune,Cassie finishes Diddy trial testimony,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546444/cassie-finishes-diddy-trial-testimony,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Sean Combs' ex-girlfriend detailed history of abuse on stand,"Casandra Ventura, the ex-girlfriend of music mogul Sean Combs, on Friday finished four gruelling days on the witness stand in his sex trafficking trial, testifying in graphic, deeply personal terms about years of abuse including rape, reported AFP. Combs is facing federal charges of sex trafficking and leading an illegal sex ring that enforced its power with crimes including arson, kidnapping and bribery - and Ventura's testimony is core to the prosecution's case. Ventura - the singer known as Cassie, who is heavily pregnant with her third child - told jurors that Combs raped, beat and forced her into degrading, drug-fuelled sex parties dubbed ""freak-offs"" throughout their decade-plus relationship. In the final stretch of her testimony in a Manhattan courtroom, Ventura faced a blitz of questions over a $20 million settlement she received from Combs in a separate civil case prior to the start of criminal proceedings. She said she was also set to receive $10 million in another settlement with the Intercontinental Hotel, where Combs assaulted her in a 2016 incident caught on camera that was aired in open court. Ventura remained largely composed throughout the week but broke down near the end of her testimony. ""I'd give that money back if I never had to do freak-offs,"" she said through tears in an emotional crescendo, referring to the marathon sex parties with male escorts she says Combs systematically subjected her to. ""I would have had agency and autonomy. I wouldn't have had to work so hard to get it back,"" she said. She said Combs's treatment of her made her feel ""worthless."" The defence sought to tarnish her credibility with painstaking readings of years-old text messages between the couple, emphasising that she stayed with Combs despite the alleged abuse, and pointing to times when she had acted violently. ""I will kill you,"" Ventura was heard saying in an audio recording to a man she believed had a video of a freak-off. Defence lawyer Anna Estevao highlighted tender text exchanges, and implied drug addiction had played a key role in Combs's rage. Ventura insisted there was subtext to many of the suggestive or keen messages she sent to Combs over the years, and that she often felt pressured into freak-offs with the music industry heavyweight, especially as she was signed to his label. ""I worried for my safety. I worried for my career. But I also was in love with him, so I worried that he wouldn't want to be with me"" if she didn't comply with his demands, she said. 'Extremely challenging' Ventura's lawyer Douglas Wigdor read a statement on her behalf, after she wearily left the courtroom holding her belly. ""This week has been extremely challenging, but also remarkably empowering and healing,"" she said. She said she hoped her testimony would help other abuse survivors and asked for privacy as she prepares to give birth. ""I am glad to put this chapter of my life to rest,"" she said. In a separate statement, also read by Wigdor, Ventura's husband Alex Fine praised her ""strength and bravery"" while adding he felt ""profound anger"" as he sat in court ""in front of a person who tried to break her."" Combs initially introduced Fine and Ventura, who already have two children together, it was stated in court. Many weeks to come Combs, 55, made hundreds of millions in the music, fashion, media and liquor industries and is often credited with helping to bring hip-hop into the mainstream. But the rap producer and global superstar once famous for his lavish parties now appears visibly aged after months in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges but faces life in prison if convicted. The defence contends that while Ventura's relationship with Combs was complicated and included domestic abuse, it did not amount to sex trafficking. Late in the day, prosecutors began questioning Dawn Richard - a singer who found fame on MTV's reality show Making the Band, which Combs produced. Richard previously filed a separate civil suit against Combs alleging sexual assault and battery. She told jurors on Friday she witnessed Combs attempt to hit Ventura over the head with a skillet. Proceedings are expected to continue into the summer."
Pakistan,Tribune,Pakistan identifies six new trade corridors,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546454/pakistan-identifies-six-new-trade-corridors,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Routes will connect Central Asia, Europe and Russia via China, Afghanistan and Iran","Pakistan has identified six potential trade corridors connecting Central Asia, Europe and Russia through China, Afghanistan and Iran. These include road networks from Karachi to Moscow via China and Kazakhstan, from Gwadar to Moscow via Afghanistan and through Turkmenistan and Iran to Azerbaijan and Russia. Speaking at the closing session of the Kazan Forum, Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan stated that Pakistan did not merely aspire to serve as a transit point between South Asia and Central Asia but rather aimed to function as an economic bridge, said a press release issued on Saturday. He emphasised that Pakistan had been actively engaged in regional cooperation through various agreements signed in recent years and via proactive participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. He highlighted that the Mazar-e-Sharif to Kohat railway project was expected to cost approximately $633 million. Meanwhile, the Gwadar Port has begun shipment and cargo services as Pakistan intends to facilitate Central Asia's access to warm waters. The federal minister reiterated Pakistan's deep interest in enhancing North-South connectivity in the communications sector, adding that the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway (M-6) was a focal project for good investment. He said that since 2023, the National Logistics Corporation (NLC) had been providing cargo services to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Moreover, in August last year, Pakistan introduced a visa-on-arrival facility for citizens of 126 countries to promote trade and investment. Abdul Aleem elaborated on Pakistan's strategic plans to connect Karachi, Quetta and Gwadar with Central Asia and Europe through road networks. Also, work is continuing on a pilot project to build a railway line to Russia via Iran. He welcomed the organisation of the Kazan Forum and reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to playing an active role in regional development. He particularly expressed gratitude to Russian President Vladimir Putin for hosting the forum. On the sidelines of the event, the federal minister held a bilateral meeting and a joint session with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin, accompanied by their respective delegations. Discussions centred on enhancing bilateral cooperation across various sectors with particular emphasis on investment in the communications sector. The minister expressed Pakistan's strong interest in developing a broad-based partnership with Russia. The Russian deputy PM underscored Moscow's desire for comprehensive regional development and mutual collaboration. He welcomed Pakistan's participation in the Kazan Forum and expressed willingness to strengthen cooperation with Islamabad in economic, cultural and other fields."
Pakistan,Tribune,Experts aim to promote cybersecurity,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546453/experts-aim-to-promote-cybersecurity,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,It emerges as crucial strength of Pakistan that will build strong image globally,"Tech experts, strategists and chief executives of IT companies have vowed to promote Pakistan as one of the leading cybersecurity solution providers after it played an instrumental role in getting an edge over India during the recent conventional war. IT companies see cybersecurity solutions as an opportunity to grow as it is an emerging field in the modern world, which can be considered either a challenge or an essential strength of every country, company or entity. For the first time, cyber warfare was witnessed by the world during the military conflict between Pakistan and India, enhancing significantly the importance of cybersecurity and its related technological solutions. Tech expert and former Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) chairman Muhammad Zohaib Khan said cybersecurity has proved to be a crucial strategic strength of Pakistan in achieving superiority during air and ground military operations, which will not only further build a strong image of the country in IT, but will also aid in ramping up its exports to different countries. He said Pakistani IT companies have already established their reputation as quality and innovative service providers in various countries and their ethical hackers and cybersecurity professionals are a highly preferred choice by renowned companies across the world. It is high time that Pakistani IT companies ought to work aggressively to promote cybersecurity and AI security solutions in a host of countries to enhance the volume of exports, he remarked. What's more, cybersecurity is a specialised field, which fetches high-value projects from foreign clients while considering their customised requirements. IT exporter and Hexalyze CEO Saad Shah said Pakistani authorities, in collaboration with local companies, should foster Pakistan's new specialty in defence and commercial aspects at government-to-government levels and through global trade fairs. He said the world would be surprised to see that Pakistan with merely $3 billion of exports per annum dominated vis-a-vis a country considered the global IT hub with exports of hundreds of billions of dollars. He pointed out that Pakistan will not only boost its exports, but will also explore new markets in the Middle East and Asean region for its cyber and AI solution providers. The government should roll out a comprehensive policy for public and private sector entities and establish cybersecurity departments to protect their assets and businesses effectively from cyberattacks in the wake of recent military clash with the neighbouring state. The World Economic Forum's Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2023 report shows the world needs 3.4 million cybersecurity experts to support today's global economy, but the industry is struggling to fill that gap. The biggest threat to cybersecurity is the unavailability of its professionals worldwide, the report said. P@SHA AI Committee member and IT expert Mehwish Salman Ali said cybersecurity professionals are limited across the world and the situation is same in Pakistan, hence, IT companies and universities should impart training to professionals through boot camps and specialised degrees on a war footing. Realising the ever-increasing importance of cybersecurity and its implementation through AI, the government should allocate a budget for this particular field and introduce an updated curriculum in consultation with industry experts. Pakistan should prepare cyber guards in large numbers to cater to its national requirements as well as the emerging global demand, which is highly possible considering the youth population and their tendency to acquire IT skills, she said. The chief executive officers of various IT companies suggested that the government and the private sector should develop an aggressive strategy to train professionals as cyber guards - specialists, consultants and experts. Besides, three to six-month boot camps for the aspiring professionals, degrees from one-year diploma to bachelor programmes on a medium-term basis and MS to PhD programmes on a long-term basis should be launched in universities."
Pakistan,Tribune,Iqra Aziz believes there is no excuse to hit a child,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546446/iqra-aziz-believes-there-is-no-excuse-to-hit-a-child,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Actor condemns father's public outburst in viral clip,"Actor Iqra Aziz has spoken out strongly against a viral incident showing a father slapping his child in public. The incident, which was captured on video and widely circulated on social media, showed a man striking his son across the face, allegedly in response to the child being too loud while skating. The footage sparked outrage, and Iqra was among the first celebrities to publicly call out the behaviour. Sharing the video on her Instagram Story, Iqra penned a powerful message addressing the deep-rooted culture of corporal punishment in Pakistani households. ""No action is big enough for you to slap or hit your child in public, in front of family or even (alone) in a room,"" she wrote. As a desi parent herself, Iqra acknowledged how difficult it can be to break free from generational cycles of violence, especially when many parents today were once children punished for being ""too naughty, too loud,"" or simply not obedient enough. Iqra emphasised that children are not miniature adults; they are vulnerable and still learning how to behave. ""Please understand your child is new to this world at every stage of his/her life,"" she wrote. ""He's younger than you, vulnerable and experiencing things differently. Someone has to break the cycle."" Iqra's words resonated widely, with social media users applauding her for shedding light on a normalised but harmful parenting practice. One user commented, ""Islam does not allow slapping across the face. The child should have been disciplined at home."" Another added, ""Violence has become a part of our DNA. This is not acceptable."" As per another netizen, practices like these are behind people complaining ""their kids don't care for them in old age."" Pakistan has no federal law explicitly banning corporal punishment at home, though efforts like the Islamabad Capital Territory Prohibition of Corporal Punishment Act (2021) exist. Advocacy groups have long pushed for stronger child protection laws nationwide. With big hits such as Suno Chanda and Mannat Murad in her portfolio, Iqra's long credited her success to her love for the craft. ""I like to express myself. Maybe during that journey, I made such good friends with the camera that the moment it comes in front of me, I become a different person,"" she said, appearing as a guest on The Pick & Drop Show last year. While celebrities typically find themselves socialising a lot in showbiz, Iqra maintained that contrary to her usual on-screen persona, she is a very private person. ""Off-screen, it's not very often that I am able to make friends with people."""

Pakistan,Tribune,Severe heatwave persists across country,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546489/severe-heatwave-persists-across-country,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Authorities urge citizens to stay cool and avoid unnecessary outdoor activity.,"A severe heatwave is affecting large parts of country, with temperatures reaching unusually high and potentially hazardous levels. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a warning, forecasting daytime temperatures to remain 5 to 7°C above normal in the upper half of the country, including central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. In the southern half, including Sindh, southern Punjab, and Balochistan, temperatures are expected to remain 4 to 6°C above normal. The ongoing extreme heat is being driven by a high-pressure system prevailing over central and southern parts of the country, which is likely to persist through the next 72 hours. The highest temperature recorded in the country over the past 24 hours was 48°C in Dadu. Other extremely hot locations included Rahim Yar Khan and Jacobabad at 47°C, and Mohenjo-daro, DG Khan, Bahawalnagar, Sibi, Nokundi, and Bhakkar at 46°C. Weather conditions in most areas have remained dry and hot, with intense heat particularly affecting the plains. Forecasts suggest that cities across Sindh, including Nawabshah, Mithi, Mohenjo-daro, Sukkur, Hyderabad, and Karachi, will continue to experience scorching temperatures well above 40°C. Dadu is likely to remain one of the hottest cities in the coming days, with temperatures potentially ranging between 47 to 49°C. Karachi is forecast to remain hot but less extreme, with maximum temperatures around 35 to 37°C accompanied by high humidity levels. Meanwhile, isolated rain, windstorms, or thunderstorms are possible during the evening and night in parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, upper Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and northeastern Punjab, including the Potohar region. Hailstorms may also occur in a few areas on Monday. However, these weather events are not expected to impact temperatures significantly or bring broader relief from the heatwave. Health officials have issued advisories urging the public to avoid direct sunlight, stay indoors during peak hours, and drink plenty of fluids. The extreme heat poses serious health risks, especially for vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and outdoor workers. Emergency services across the affected regions remain on high alert."

The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a heatwave alert, warning of soaring temperatures across major cities and plains of Punjab until May 19. ""There is a risk of an unusual spike in temperatures over the next few days,"" a PDMA spokesperson cautioned, adding that temperatures could remain 4 to 7°C above normal until May 20. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Lahore recorded a minimum temperature of 28°C, with the mercury expected to rise to 43°C in the coming days. The department forecast hot and dry weather to persist for the next two to three days, ruling out any chances of rain. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) recorded the minimum temperature in Lahore at 28°C, with forecasts suggesting the maximum could rise to a blistering 44°C. The weather is likely to remain hot and dry over the next two to three days, with no chances of rain during this period. Extreme hot weather has disturbed academic activities, especially for children in small private schools because of poor facilities in classrooms. The situation is alarming in schools operating in small buildings in cities, including Lahore, which even lack adequate facilities of fans and water. Students in remote districts also suffer during the closing and mid-day hours of schools when the temperature rises. The Punjab government is likely to consider closing the educational institutions in the province because of the harsh weather and a meeting for the purpose is expected later this week. The increasing temperature during the past week made it difficult for young children to study in in the congested classrooms. The worst situation is being faced in small schools constructed in violation of rules that lack the facilities required to continue academic activities. Health experts have urged the public to stay hydrated, consume cooling fluids and cover their heads when venturing outdoors to reduce the risk of heatstroke. Meanwhile, thick plumes of smoke blanketed sections of the Lahore-Islamabad and Lahore-Sialkot motorways after farmers set fire to crop stubble late at night, in violation of environmental regulations."
Pakistan,Tribune,Man-made famine,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546397/man-made-famine,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,.,"On May 11, just hours before Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander was released by Hamas, the nation of Gaza was celebrating news of a nearing ceasefire. Soon after Edan was received by his family, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that his country is ""on the eve of a forceful entry to Gaza"". While international politicians negotiate and Palestinian civilians are deceived over and over again, Gaza slowly sinks into a man-made famine caused by an almost 3-month-long blockade of food and medical aid. A recent UN report suggests that 93% of the population of Gaza is currently living through high levels of acute food insecurity, with 1 in 5 people at risk of death due to starvation. A situation of unimaginable horrors in Gaza is once again at the mercy of a temperamental fascist. Exactly a year ago, the people of Gaza were reportedly boiling weeds and eating animal feed to stave off their hunger. Now, the situation has worsened even further. Warehouses of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) that store aid stand empty, along with most supermarkets and local shops. If food miraculously exists, it sits as a mere symbol of unattainability for most of the population. This is because food prices have soared for basic goods such as wheat flour — which has experienced a three thousand per cent price spike since February. As Israel purposefully starves almost 2 million people by refusing to let any food or medical supplies enter the region, it blames Hamas for causing hunger by allegedly stealing aid. But the extended blockade along with threats of escalated violence paint only one picture: Israel is wilfully using starvation as a weapon of war. It is loudly and publicly engaging in a war crime and an open human rights violation — all while international communities and leaders stand by and watch."

Pakistan,Tribune,Curbing child marriage,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546396/curbing-child-marriage,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,.,"In a long-overdue move, the National Assembly has passed a landmark bill aimed at curbing child marriage and forced conversions - two deeply intertwined abuses that have quietly devastated countless lives across Pakistan. Tabled by MNA Sharmila Faruqui of the PPP and passed unanimously on Friday, the bill represents a rare moment of political unity and moral clarity in a legislative environment often hampered by indecision and appeasement. Following the lead of Sindh and Punjab, the Islamabad Capital Territory has now adopted bold legal provisions that set 18 as the minimum legal age for marriage for both girls and boys. The bill mandates that no Nikkah registrar may solemnise a marriage without verifying the CNICs of both individuals. Non-compliance — by parents, registrars or facilitators — will result in penalties of up to one year in prison and a fine of Rs100,000. Crucially, the legislation also repeals the outdated Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 — a colonial-era statute that has long failed to protect vulnerable children and has often served as a smokescreen for inaction. For decades, entire networks operating under religious and feudal cover have abducted underage girls, producing fabricated evidence of age and consent. This new law signals a critical shift. However, legislation alone is not enough. The federal government must now follow through with robust implementation by training Nikkah registrars, launching public awareness campaigns and maintaining zero tolerance for violations. Unfortunately, K-P and Balochistan still operate under antiquated frameworks that permit the marriage of girls as young as 16. Legal uniformity across all provinces is essential. It is time to ensure that every child in Pakistan, regardless of geography, is protected under uniform laws and afforded the same right to a safe and dignified childhood."

At the core of the recent discussions between the government and the IMF has been the anticipated Rs14.307 trillion tax target, where the Washington-based lender is emphasising additional revenue measures and a rebalancing of fiscal resources. The Fund has also pushed back against the government's desire to reduce the tax burden on the salaried class, effectively accusing the government of fudging the numbers to push through a reduction after statistics showed an astounding increase of over 50% in income tax recovered from salaried individuals this year. Despite this, the IMF is averse to even raising the exempted income level, let alone revising tax slabs. At the same time, the government could do better than rely on the much-criticised Laffer Curve model to justify its tax policy. On that note, the competence of tax policymakers, up to and including members of the federal cabinet, can be gauged by the price of packaged milk. Most countries exempt milk entirely or charge a lowered rate, usually without any variance based on packaged or raw milk. In our malnutrition-riddled country, packaged milk has an 18% tax rate, while raw milk is tax-free. Many FBR officials reportedly see nothing wrong with this situation. Meanwhile, poor urban dwellers must find a local cow if they want to get milk at an affordable price. More common ground could be found, however, on privatisation-related issues. While sales of state assets are only one-time income, ridding the exchequer of bleeding assets brings long-term savings that help balance the budget. The government could use these savings as justification for reducing some of the income tax burden or increasing some public spending, especially since there is likely to be a bump in the defence budget due to the simmering threat of conflict with India."
Pakistan,Tribune,Paradise on the earth,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546394/paradise-on-the-earth,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,.,"All that I am or hope to be, I owe to my angel mother. — Abraham Lincoln The world around us — its mountains and plains, oceans and skies, flora and fauna — all reflect the magnificent artistry of the Creator. Since childhood, we have heard the guiding words: ""Hell for the sinner and Paradise for the winner"", reminding us that our actions in this world determine our fate in the hereafter. The idea of Paradise lost or gained is rooted in obedience or disobedience. According to the Holy Scriptures, Paradise is described as a blissful abode — a realm of true honour and eternal peace. It is adorned with rivers of water, milk and honey, and filled with gardens, fruits, and rewards beyond human imagination. Truly, the vision of Paradise as depicted in religious texts is breathtaking. When I ponder on the verses of the Qur'an, I sometimes feel that I am already experiencing a taste of Paradise — right here on Earth. I live in a kingdom filled with honour, warmth and unconditional love. That kingdom is my mother's love. Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, ""Al Jannah Tahta Aqdam a- ummahat"" i.e. ""Paradise lies beneath the feet of your mothers."" This divine prediction, found in the Hadiths and Sunnah over 1,400 years ago, captures the essence of what it means to be truly loved. A mother's love knows no boundaries. It rises to the heavens when she conceives, carrying the child for nine months, enduring pain and discomfort with every passing day. The suffering she endures during pregnancy and childbirth is beyond any repayment. How can one ever repay even a single sleepless night of a mother? From birth to infancy, through sleepless nights and tireless days, a mother nurtures her child with milk, care and unwavering affection. Medical science recommends 6-8 hours of sleep for good health, yet mothers forgo their rest for the sake of their children. Their sacrifices begin at birth and never truly end. A mother shapes her child not only physically but morally and emotionally. From the early years to adolescence (ages 7 to 14), she plays a crucial role in guiding the child's social, academic and emotional development and helps the child in navigating early adolescence. She stands like a shield against the world's challenges, a lighthouse in the darkest storms. Throughout history, maternal love has stood tall. From Jochebed, the mother of Moses (AS), who risked everything to save her son, to Maryam, the mother of Jesus (AS), who bore her divine child with grace, to Hajra, the mother of Ismail (AS), who ran between Safa and Marwa in search of water, and so beloved was her act that it became a ritual for all believers to perform it. Mothers across all eras have faced pain to provide peace and comfort to their children, making their arms feel like paradise on the earth. While there is no single day that can encapsulate a mother's love, the month of May — especially the second Sunday — is dedicated worldwide as Mother's Day, a time to honour and celebrate these incredible women. From flowers to gifts and heartfelt greetings, people express their gratitude and affection in beautiful ways. Yet, no words can ever fully capture the depth of a mother's love. The world may be divided by wealth and status, but a mother's love is universal — unparalleled, unconditional and divine. To every child, a mother is the world, and in her presence, we find paradise on the earth. Even the poor mother does not let her child know the pangs of hunger caused by poverty. To fulfil the desire of her child, she resorts to any extent. So, love your mother in every form. Cherish her, salute her dignity, and recognise that in her presence, you are already living in a glimpse of eternal bliss. Isn't it paradise on the earth?"
Pakistan,Tribune,Kanye West calls Virgil Abloh’s death a message for those who ‘steal’ from him,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2542793/kanye-west-calls-virgil-ablohs-death-a-message-for-those-who-steal-from-him,"April 28, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Ye cannot seem to keep his late friend's name out of his mouth.,"Kanye West, now known simply as Ye, has sparked intense conversation once again, this time during a Parti livestream with Sneako over the weekend. The rapper and fashion icon used Virgil Abloh’s death as a heavy-handed example of what happens to people who, in his view, ""steal"" from him. At around the 15-minute mark of the stream, Ye shared, “You know when ns be really mad? It’s when you actually give them something ‘cause they don't want to actually receive, so they want to take it from them. But if you give it to them, it’ll make it really make them feel bad like, ‘Damn.’ And then the best? The blessings are bestowed as I bestow grace on these ns.” Ye didn’t stop there. He continued, “And I'm like, man, ns who go against me be dead, bro. Ns who steal from me, bro, look at Virgil, he dead, bro. N****s who steal from me and try to take the king position be dead, bro.” Doubling down on his statements, he added, “When we say ‘watch the throne,’ it's only one throne. It's only one king, and we know who the king is obviously. Who y'all watching, who y'all care about?” Just a minute deeper into the conversation, Ye connected Abloh’s appointment as Louis Vuitton’s artistic director in 2018 to personal trauma, along with ""dealing with [his] children"" and the death of his mother back in 2007. This is far from the first time Ye has spoken harshly about Virgil Abloh since his passing from a private cancer battle in 2021. Earlier this year, Ye posted a fiery rant on X (formerly Twitter), where he said, “I LOVE TRAV VIRGIL AND DRAKE DRAKE THE REALEST ONE OF THOSE THREE THOUGH HE NOT FAKE COOL HE’S JUST TALENTED AF AND YES ITS FUCK VIRGIL AND ANY OF THESE OTHER N****S THAT WORKED FOR ME THAN USED ME THEN WENT AGAINST ME I LOVE VIRGIL AND HE USED THAT VERY LOVE TO BEAT NIGERIANS ARE SUPER SMART.”  Ye also out right tweeted, 'F*** Virgil. His tweet sent a shockwave to fans since the two had a long standing friendship.  Earlier this year, West also revealed why he turned on Abloh.  While many fans still mourn Abloh’s contributions to fashion and culture, Ye’s comments are yet another reminder of the complicated legacy between the two former collaborators."
Pakistan,Tribune,"Same slides, new fiscal year",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546400/same-slides-new-fiscal-year,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,.,"It is that time of the year again. No, not mango season — though that might offer more sweetness than what is coming. It is pre-budget seminar season in Pakistan, our annual economic charade where universities, think tanks, chambers of commerce, and just about every office with a whiteboard and Wi-Fi hold solemn gatherings to discuss 'The Way Forward'. PowerPoint clickers are charged, macroeconomic jargon is dusted off, and economists reappear like migratory birds, repeating the same truths that have now become ritual chants. One wonders: is there a secret mandate from the Ministry of Finance compelling every economics department to host at least one budget seminar before June? Or is it just national cosplay everyone pretending their budget recommendations will somehow find their way into the corridors of power, where the actual budget is being stitched together in Excel sheets, under IMF supervision and political desperation? The truth is that these seminars have become Pakistan's economic folklore. They appear in May, make a bit of noise, generate a few tweets, and vanish without a trace much like the budgets they try to influence. Let us take a moment to salute our brave economic commentators. Year after year, they appear on stage like clockwork, armed with the same prescriptions: broaden the tax base, rationalise subsidies, increase exports, fix the energy sector, reduce the fiscal deficit, and invest in human capital. They are not wrong. But it is hard not to notice that they have been saying the same things since 2020. Or was it 2010? Actually, some of these slides are so old you can almost smell the Windows XP on them. One prominent economist even used the exact same line this year as last: ""We must delink politics from economic policy."" If only he could also delink himself from this loop of budget déjà vu. And then there are the PowerPoint slides, gloriously adorned with World Bank graphs and IMF warnings, showcasing declining tax-to-GDP ratios (currently hovering around 9.2 per cent, the lowest in South Asia), rising debt-to-GDP (77.8 per cent in FY24), and current account deficits as if they were horoscope signs. Everyone nods solemnly. We have seen this show before. Now let us ask the forbidden question: do these recommendations ever reach the Ministry of Finance? If they do, is there a designated intern who bins them with a polite auto-reply? Or do they simply fade into the budget void like an old PC's startup sound? One can only imagine the Finance Division receiving a report titled 'Budget Reform Proposal from Institute of Economic Rethinking' and responding with a group chuckle before going back to their IMF spreadsheets. There is no evidence — none that these seminars have ever substantively influenced a federal budget. Not even a footnote. Even more absurd is that the actual budget-makers — bureaucrats, special assistants and IMF whisperers - rarely attend these events. It is like holding wedding rehearsals without the bride and groom. The audience is often a mix of students, donors, NGO representatives and retired civil servants enjoying the air conditioning. What we are witnessing is not policy input. It is policy theater. There are photo opportunities, panel selfies, hashtags and post-event pressers. Some speakers use it to test-drive op-ed ideas. Others hope to impress the donors in the room. And a few institutions hold these seminars so that they can say in their annual report: ""XYZ Think Tank contributed to budget discourse through a high-level policy roundtable."" And why not? The show must go on. After all, what else are we to do when the economic reality is bleak and largely pre-decided? Pakistan's FY25 budget will be written with one eye on the IMF (which has already demanded a tax revenue target of Rs12.97 trillion), and another on urgent financing needs from bilateral partners and financial markets. Within this harsh matrix, how practical is it to propose, say, ""cutting non-development expenditures"" when 52 per cent of the budget is already going to interest payments and another 11 per cent to defence? What is the point of ""rationalising tax exemptions"" when those with the power to tax are often the ones enjoying those exemptions? And why talk about ""reforming state-owned enterprises"" when PIA and Pakistan Steel are now punchlines, not policy goals? If this sounds cynical, it is but it is also empirically accurate. Our pre-budget seminars are economic rituals, not reform tools. Like a high-budget drama serial that resets every season, they offer emotional highs, some tears for the middle class, and the illusion of progress. In 2023, over two dozen budget seminars were held in Islamabad alone. Yet Pakistan still missed its fiscal targets, borrowed five billion dollars more than expected, and delayed reforms on pension and energy subsidies again. Even as inflation briefly catches its breath at 0.3 per cent, the rupee continues its downward yoga, and foreign reserves dance around the eight billion dollar line with the enthusiasm of a tired ballerina. So why do we continue this spectacle? Because, much like sending good wishes to the Pakistan cricket team, it makes us feel better even when we know the outcome. To be clear, debate is not the problem. Dialogue is necessary. But repetition without impact is a form of national gaslighting. If the same economists are saying the same things at the same places with the same results, maybe just maybe the problem is not the budget. It is the echo chamber. Let us save the seminar snacks, reduce paper waste, and redirect some of that pre-budget energy toward pushing for parliamentary hearings, public budget scorecards or citizen audit tools. Until then, happy seminar season! Pass the microphone and the samosas."
Pakistan,Tribune,Tainted wit and piety?,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546398/tainted-wit-and-piety,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,.,"Throughout the ages, sages, empathetic individuals and characters who emerged in different times and advocated for positive change have often been idolised and held in high esteem for their selflessness, implied openness to scrutiny, and impact on people's lives. The same holds, though with frequent letdowns, disillusionments and betrayals in our part of the world today. This is manifested in the sea of characters around us, seemingly echoing and reincarnating Moses, Mandela, Mother Teresa, Nietzsche, Orwell, Galileo, as well as Winfrey, Socrates, Wollstonecraft, Luxemburg, Locke, Hammurabi, Aurelius, Lincoln, Marshall, Mill, Burke, Erasmus, Voltaire, Spartacus, Bismarck, Bingen, Assisi, Avicenna, Cohen and others. Yet, as they multiply, so does the gravity of the issues they seemingly oppose — a stark paradox that raises questions: Why did relatively few authorities on intellect and humanism thrive during periods constrained by classicism and obscurantism? Why do intellectual pursuits and advocacy often seem at odds with driving meaningful change in an era where gaining attention and public trust isn't that demanding? First, most reformists of public causes were driven by their conviction and directly led through action, endured oppression, and ultimately weathered the storm afflicting people. However, today's most ambitious tactfully rely on unquestionable people's support and acknowledgement, implying that they lack faith in and reluctantly practise the ideals and change they tend to seek. When they succeed in earning public trust, they collude with and complement the oppressive status quo, advance their vested interests, and ultimately act as a check against popular resistance by repeatedly offering the same pledge veneered in different colours. Second, most influential intellectuals and empaths were shaped by societal aggression in the past. They either had genuine empathy for the aggrieved or had personally experienced suffering, or both, and had confronted the aggression head-on. Fueled by personal conviction, they worked tirelessly, leaving an enduring legacy that outlasted them. Many champions of various causes are often incidental, inherited or circumstantial, rising to fill the void left by their predecessors' repeated betrayals. Consequently, they pursue personal interests, grow affluent, empower aggressors, and exacerbate the issues they claim to oppose. Third, due to widespread ignorance in the past, public trust in movements and their advocates often stemmed from the latter's integrity, selflessness and practical actions. However, despite relative awareness today, most trust in our champions stems from past betrayals, exhaustion from systemic aggression, or both. Moreover, our champions' exploitation of our ignorance, grievances and manipulative schemes makes us prone to repeatedly entrusting them — only to discover trust betrayed for personal gain. Fourth, most reformers, back in the day, were from among the commoners and aggrieved. They, instead of colluding with the oppressors, struggled for collective welfare. However, most of our champions hail from the socio-economic strata lying at the core of the systematic oppression. Therefore, despite their claims of advocating for the marginalised, they secretly work to reinforce the status quo. Don't they? Can one seriously believe that a so-called messiah, living in luxury, would genuinely advocate for equality, sacrificing their wealth and privileged lifestyle? Fifth, unlike in the past, most movements today are divergent and superficial, each promising a different approach to tackling issues in ways that align with their vested interests and ideological leanings. In this manner, public attention is fragmented, leading people to cling to multiple false hopes. None of these ultimately arrest, let alone resolve, the actual issues. Thus, most media figures, writers, politicians, human rights activists, liberals, feminists, clergy, pirs and jurists effectively betray the cause, much like Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus. Last but not least, the challenges faced by ordinary people become a lucrative opportunity for the chameleonic champions of the public cause, serving as a stepping stone to joining Orwell's ""more equal"" class."

Pakistan,Tribune,7 surprising foods that boost your gut health (backed by science),https://tribune.com.pk/story/2542754/7-surprising-foods-that-boost-your-gut-health-backed-by-science,"April 28, 2025",Tribune News Desk,What you eat today can shape your gut and your health for years to come.,"When people think of gut health, they usually picture yogurt, kefir, or maybe the occasional probiotic supplement. But the truth is, maintaining a healthy gut microbiome goes far beyond the usual suspects. Your gut, home to trillions of bacteria, plays a vital role not only in digestion but also in immunity, mental health, and even skin clarity. According to a 2022 review published in Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology, diverse diets rich in prebiotics, polyphenols, and fermented foods are key to cultivating a thriving microbiome. If you're looking to support your gut health in a more creative way, here are seven unexpected foods, backed by science, that can make a real difference.  Good news for chocolate lovers: dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa) contains polyphenols that act like fuel for beneficial gut bacteria. Research in Frontiers in Nutrition (2021) shows that cocoa flavonoids help increase populations of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, two crucial ""good"" bacteria.  Popular in Japanese cuisine, edible seaweeds like nori, wakame, and kombu are rich in fibre and unique polysaccharides. Studies, including one in Marine Drugs (2020), show that these fibres serve as excellent prebiotics, feeding beneficial bacteria and even supporting the growth of less common gut microbes.  While ripe bananas are a source of simple sugars, unripe green bananas are packed with resistant starch, a type of fibre that resists digestion and feeds healthy gut bacteria. Clinical research published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2019) found resistant starch can boost butyrate production, a short-chain fatty acid crucial for colon health.  Jerusalem and globe artichokes are among the richest natural sources of inulin, a powerful prebiotic fibre. A study in The British Journal of Nutrition (2016) found that consuming artichoke extract significantly increased Bifidobacteria levels in healthy adults.  This fermented soybean paste is a staple in Japanese cooking and is loaded with probiotics. According to a 2022 paper in Foods, regular consumption of miso can enhance microbiota diversity and reduce markers of inflammation in the gut.  These nuts are more than just a snack — they are packed with fibre and polyphenols. A controlled trial published in The Journal of Nutrition (2014) found that participants who ate pistachios daily had significantly higher levels of beneficial gut bacteria compared to those who ate almonds.  Bursting with antioxidants and fibre, pomegranate seeds (also called arils) have been shown to modulate the gut microbiome positively. A 2021 review in Nutrients found that pomegranate polyphenols can promote the growth of anti-inflammatory bacterial strains and may help repair the gut lining."

For her Sunday set, the Blackpink star wore a full Mugler ensemble, showcasing standout archival pieces from the fashion house. Her outfit centred around a buckled wrap coat dress from Thierry Mugler’s iconic spring 1992 Les Cow-boys collection. She paired it with striking red vinyl shorts, blending high fashion with rodeo flair.  The Les Cow-boys line was a bold homage to motorcycle and Western culture, featuring statement-making designs such as fringe skirts, cowhide suits, and leather chaps. Jennie isn’t the first pop icon to tap into the collection’s legacy. Back in 2008, Beyoncé wore a motorcycle-style bustier from Les Cow-boys while promoting her album “I Am…Sasha Fierce.” Stylist Park Min Hee was behind Jennie’s latest Coachella transformation. On 11 April, Min Hee had already dressed Jennie in another Western-inspired look for weekend one of the festival.   That ensemble featured a crocodile-embossed jacket and matching bra top from Georges Hobeika’s autumn 2025 collection, completed with custom mini shorts by Cotton Candy LA. Min Hee has played a pivotal role in shaping Blackpink’s fashion since 2017, including styling the group in custom Mugler during their 2023 Coachella appearance as headliners.  Jennie’s weekend two set included 12 songs, among them fan favourites like “Mantra,” “F.T.S.,” “Like JENNIE,” and a surprise on-stage collaboration with Kali Uchis for “Damn Right.” Outside of her performances, Jennie continues to represent Chanel globally. Since 2017, she has fronted campaigns for the luxury label, promoting its fashion and beauty lines across the world."
Pakistan,Tribune,"After 15 years, 'King of the Hill' is returning to TV on Hulu",https://tribune.com.pk/story/2541511/after-15-years-king-of-the-hill-is-returning-to-tv-on-hulu,"April 22, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Barbecue, propane, and Bobby Hill.","After more than a decade off air, King of the Hill is officially returning with a brand new season on Hulu. The beloved animated series, which originally aired from 1997 to 2010 across 13 seasons and over 250 episodes, was known for its blend of subtle humour, heartfelt storytelling, and its grounded portrayal of small-town American life. Set in the fictional town of Arlen, Texas, the show followed propane salesman Hank Hill, whose conservative values often clashed with the eccentricities of his family and neighbours. Its charm lay in its sincerity, steering away from the exaggerated antics of other adult animations of the time. Now, Season 14 is set to premiere later this summer, marking the first batch of new episodes in 15 years. Fans will get an exclusive sneak peek during a panel at the ATX TV Festival on Friday 30 May. The panel will include co-creators Mike Judge and Greg Daniels, new showrunner Saladin K. Patterson, and cast members Pamela Adlon, Toby Huss, and Lauren Tom. This special event will not only provide behind-the-scenes stories from the original run but will also unveil the long-awaited first look at the revival. Fittingly, a barbecue celebration will follow the panel—an ode to the show’s backyard banter and Hank Hill’s love for propane. It is currently unclear whether the exclusive preview will be made available online, meaning festival attendees may be the only ones to view the early footage. The revival is rumoured to be set in present-day America, featuring a time jump that advances the story nearly a decade from the series finale. This modern setting promises a nostalgic yet updated look at life in Arlen as the Hill family and their neighbours adjust to the changing times.  While many plot details remain a mystery, cast members have shared that characters will age in line with the time skip. One of the most notable updates is that Bobby Hill is now a budding chef based in Dallas. His new culinary lifestyle is expected to contrast sharply with Hank’s more traditional views, creating opportunities for both laughs and touching moments. As for the other residents of Arlen, their stories are still under wraps. The revival is expected to address the absence of characters whose voice actors have sadly passed away since the show’s original run.  Much of the original voice cast will be returning for the reboot, including Mike Judge as Hank, Kathy Najimy as Peggy, Stephen Root as Bill, Pamela Adlon as Bobby, and Lauren Tom as Minh. Their return is set to revive the unique comedic rhythm and warmth fans associate with the series. However, not every character’s future is clear. The passing of Brittany Murphy and Tom Petty leaves questions around the characters of Luanne and Lucky. It also remains to be seen whether Toby Huss will return as Kahn. One emotional highlight of the new season will be the return of Dale Gribble. Johnny Hardwick, who voiced the fan-favourite character, had recorded several episodes before his sudden death in August 2023. These recordings mean fans will get to hear his iconic voice one last time."
Pakistan,Tribune,'Sinners' is too good to miss—here’s why (no spoilers),https://tribune.com.pk/story/2541502/sinners-is-too-good-to-missheres-why-no-spoilers,"April 22, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan have done it again.,"Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan have officially redefined what an original blockbuster can be. Their latest collaboration, Sinners, a supernatural thriller set in the American South during the 1930s, is not only earning rave reviews, but also making history at the global box office. The film, already the #1 movie in the U.S., has delivered the biggest domestic opening weekend for an original film this decade. It’s even eclipsed the launch of Jordan Peele’s Us, which pulled in $71 million in 2019. For the horror genre, Sinners has set an all-new benchmark that’s never been reached before, combining thrilling scares with thought-provoking depth and rich cultural storytelling.  Coogler and Jordan are no strangers to success. Their joint filmography boasts Fruitvale Station, Creed, and both Black Panther films — a legacy of powerful, genre-defining cinema. In Sinners, the duo steps into even darker, bolder territory. Coogler’s direction has reached a new peak, raising the bar set by his past hits. Meanwhile, Jordan shines in a dual role as twins Smoke and Stack, delivering a performance that’s both gripping and electric. The cast is rounded out by Wunmi Mosaku (Lovecraft Country) as Annie, Hailee Steinfeld (The Marvels) in a transformative role, Delroy Lindo (Malcolm X) providing humour and heart, and breakout star Miles Caton as musician Sammie Moore — a standout among a cast of powerhouses.  This isn’t your typical vampire flick. Sinners taps into classic lore with a fresh edge — complete with hoodoo influences and haunting symbolism that may reflect on the predatory forces in American history. But you didn’t hear that from me. Horror fans will be thrilled with the film’s well-crafted frights. The jump scares are strong, the atmosphere is thick with tension, and audiences will likely find themselves shouting “Run!” at the screen.  Music plays a vital role in Sinners, just as it does in life. The film honours the power of Black American music, its soul, its roots, and its evolution from blues to modern rhythms. The film uses music not just as background, but as narrative. There are cameo performances and tracks that will delight blues lovers, reminding us that “the beat changes, but the soul remains.”  Visually, Sinners is breathtaking. Coogler opted to shoot on film rather than digital, creating a nostalgic, textural richness that adds to its immersive feel. The use of vibrant colours and moody light makes every frame cinematic. For the ultimate experience, Coogler recommends watching in IMAX. Only 10 theatres worldwide are screening it in 15 perf projection format, and luckily, the Indiana State Museum’s IMAX is one of them. Don’t miss the chance to see it as the director intended.  Set in 1930s Mississippi, the story is deeply tied to Black American culture and history. Themes like sharecropping, bootlegging, lynching, and the Great Migration are all woven into the backdrop, telling stories of resilience, survival, and identity. This powerful narrative gives Sinners the weight of an instant classic — one that uses the horror genre to explore much more than monsters."

""Instead, driven by arrogance and intoxicated by power, the adversary launched a brutal attack on Pakistan, killing innocent citizens—including a child, mothers, sisters, elders, and youth—and sent a ruthless message that they could strike anywhere inside Pakistan’s territory,"" he added.  براہٍ راست: یومِ تشکر کے حوالے سے خصوصی پروگرام https://t.co/q0sOcA14gU PM Shehbaz lauded the exceptional bravery of Pakistan’s armed forces in the conflict, recounting how they shot down six enemy aircraft. “Our pilots swiftly downed Rafale jets and MiG fighters, delivering such a devastating blow that the enemy will never forget it,” he said. Despite this, the enemy continued to issue threats, prompting Pakistan to retaliate on the night of May 9. He recalled a conversation with Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, who told him, “Allow us to deliver such a slap to the enemy’s face that they will remember it for a lifetime. Following this, Pakistan’s air strikes on targets at Pathankot, Udhampur, and other locations by its pilots and Al-Khalid missiles left the enemy with nowhere to hide.""  Photo: ISPR The premier noted that COAS Munir later informed him that Pakistan had delivered a powerful response, compelling the enemy to request a ceasefire. “I told him there is no greater honor than forcing the enemy to agree to a ceasefire, and I advised accepting the offer,” he said. He further praised the use of domestically developed technology by the Air Chief Marshal and Pakistan’s pilots, deployed effectively against Indian aircraft, which amazed the world and boosted the confidence of Pakistan’s allies. “From the United States to Japan, many are acknowledging Pakistan’s armed forces for quietly mastering such advanced capabilities,“ he added. PM Shehbaz also criticised India’s claims of economic and military supremacy, noting that despite boasting of a multi-billion-dollar economy and massive defense spending, “Allah had other plans.” He stated that it was divine will that granted Pakistan this historic victory, which the nation is commemorating with deep gratitude and humility.

I believe the time has come to begin the journey for which Pakistan was created,” he stated. He further expressed gratitude to the international community, especially diplomats who supported Pakistan’s firm, fair, and just stance amid rising tensions. Read more: Cybersecurity alert issued amid rising geopolitical tensions The premier thanked friendly nations—including Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Turkiye, and China—for their efforts in promoting peace and a ceasefire in the region. He gave special appreciation to US President Donald Trump for his “brave leadership and vision” in seeking to restore peace in South Asia, crediting Trump’s strategic approach with averting what could have been a devastating war. He strongly condemned India’s baseless propaganda and false allegations regarding the Pahalgam incident, categorically denying any involvement by Pakistan, stating that “Pakistan had nothing to do with that.” PM Shehbaz warned of the grave consequences had conflict escalated further in a region home to 1.6 billion people. “God forbid if we had reached a nuclear flashpoint,” he said, “imagine who would have survived to tell what happened.”  Photo: ISPR He stressed that while Pakistan has emerged victorious, the country desires peace above all. “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but condemned aggression,” he said, adding that Pakistan hopes for a future where the region is prosperous and peaceful, built on hard work and mutual respect. The PM further stressed that Pakistan and India are permanent neighbours, whether they like it or not, and it is their choice to be either unruly or peaceful neighbours. Reflecting on the history of conflict, he noted, “We have fought three wars, but they solved nothing; instead, they brought poverty, unemployment, and many other problems to both sides.” Read more: Pakistan reaffirms support for China’s territorial integrity in Zangnan The premier extended a renewed offer to India for dialogue, urging peaceful negotiations to resolve outstanding disputes. “I don’t think we can achieve lasting peace in the region without permanent solutions to Jammu Kashmir and water-sharing issues,” he stated firmly, adding, “Once we solve these, we can then focus on trade, business exchanges, and in the field of counter-terrorism.” Highlighting Pakistan’s heavy toll in the fight against terrorism, the PM shared the loss of 90,000 Pakistani lives and economic damages amounting to $150 billion. “When was the last time any nation in the world paid even a fraction of this sacrifice?” he asked. “We are combating terrorism not just to restore peace in Pakistan but for the world at large,” he added. Earlier, the ceremony began with a Quranic recitation, which was also attended by chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, service chiefs, members of the federal cabinet, foreign diplomats, the Deputy Prime Minister, and other government officials. An aerial display by fighter jets was also part of the event, showcasing their capabilities. The performance was met with enthusiastic chants of “Long live Pakistan” from those present."

During this meeting, which took place at the Prime Minister's House in Islamabad, Shahid Afridi congratulated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the remarkable success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.  Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarar was also present during the meeting. Shahid Khan Afridi praised the armed forces for giving a strong response to India's aggression.  He stated that at this critical juncture, the entire nation united and gave a powerful reply to the enemy. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Shahid Afridi, congratulated him on his solidarity with the nation and the armed forces, and praised the successful rally that was held. Previously, Shahid Afridi strongly criticised India during a period of heightened tensions between the two countries. Afridi condemned the Indian government for its aggression and expressed full confidence in the strength and preparedness of Pakistan’s military. He dismissed India’s threats, saying Pakistan’s forces were highly trained and not easily intimidated. Responding to accusations linking Pakistan to the Pahalgam attack, Afridi called it a “false flag operation” and labelled the Modi government “inept”. Following his remarks, India reportedly blocked Afridi’s YouTube channel, along with 15 other Pakistani channels, including those of former cricketers Rashid Latif, Shoaib Akhtar, and Basit Ali. Afridi also lashed out at Indian media for its exaggerated war coverage, referring to it as “Cartoon Network” journalism. His comments resonated with many Pakistanis who believed Indian broadcasters fuelled conflict rather than reporting responsibly. Speaking at a rally in Karachi, Afridi praised Pakistan’s armed forces for what he described as a strong response to Indian aggression, stating that India had underestimated the cost of provoking Pakistan. He accused Indian forces of targeting civilians and religious sites, including mosques. Afridi also criticised Modi’s global image, referencing allegations related to attacks on Sikh activists abroad. He stated that Modi was now facing international consequences for his actions. The rally, part of the government-declared “Youm-e-Tashakur” (Day of Gratitude), saw thousands of citizens express their support for the armed forces. Tensions between Pakistan and India recently flared up after an attack in Pahalgam, India Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), killed 26 people. India blamed Pakistan without providing evidence, triggering a series of retaliatory moves including suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, cancelling visas, and scaling back diplomatic ties. Pakistan rejected the allegations and responded with reciprocal steps such as halting trade and closing its airspace to Indian aircraft. The conflict escalated on May 7 with Indian missile strikes on multiple cities in Punjab and AJK, killing dozens of civilians. Pakistan responded by downing several Indian jets and neutralising drone attacks. On May 10, Indian missile strikes targeted Pakistani airbases, prompting a retaliatory campaign—Operation Bunyan Marsoos—which hit Indian military sites. A ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump on May 11, following overnight diplomatic efforts, and was later confirmed by officials from both sides."
Pakistan,Tribune,Equal1 launches first silicon quantum computer for standard data centres,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546369/equal1-launches-first-silicon-quantum-computer-for-standard-data-centres,"May 17, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Bell-1 fits standard server racks, needs no cryogenics, and uses power like a typical enterprise GPU server.","Irish quantum computing firm Equal1 has launched what it calls the world’s first silicon-based, rack-mountable quantum computer, bringing scalable quantum processing into standard high-performance computing (HPC) environments. Named Bell-1, the system can be deployed like a traditional server—no cleanrooms, complex infrastructure, or cryogenic labs required. It fits in standard 19-inch server racks, weighs roughly 200 kilograms, and draws only 1600 watts of power, comparable to an enterprise GPU server. At the core of Bell-1 is Equal1’s UnityQ 6-qubit chip, based on silicon spin qubits manufactured using conventional semiconductor processes. A post shared by University College Dublin (@universitycollegedublin) The system integrates quantum, classical (Arm CPUs), and AI (NPUs) components into a single chip, eliminating latency issues typically found in hybrid quantum-classical systems. Bell-1 also features a closed-cycle cryo-cooling unit that cools the system to 0.3 Kelvin—colder than outer space—without relying on liquid helium or bulky dilution refrigerators. This self-contained design removes one of the major barriers to practical quantum deployment. Equal1 calls this new phase ""Quantum Computing 2.0"", aiming to shift the technology from isolated research labs into everyday commercial data centres. Industries such as finance, materials science, artificial intelligence, and pharmaceuticals are expected to benefit from real-time quantum acceleration on workloads like simulations and optimisation. “Our vision with Bell-1 was to make quantum computing accessible, scalable, and practical,” said Equal1 CEO Jason Lynch. “This is the first system designed for real-world use without compromising performance or ease of deployment.” The modular design allows for future upgrades as qubit counts rise. Rather than replacing full systems, users can swap in new chips as the UnityQ platform evolves, making Bell-1 a long-term investment for early adopters. The launch follows peer-reviewed research published by Equal1 in late 2024 that demonstrated industry-leading silicon qubit fidelity and gate speeds. The company says Bell-1 builds directly on this research, moving from laboratory prototype to production-ready quantum computing. With Bell-1, Equal1 eliminates the traditional trade-offs of quantum hardware: it is powerful, practical, scalable, and available now."
Pakistan,Tribune,Lufthansa flight left pilotless for 10 minutes,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546495/lufthansa-flight-left-pilotless-for-10-minutes,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,Captain used emergency code after multiple failed attempts to re-enter cockpit,"A Lufthansa flight was flown without an active pilot for nearly 10 minutes after the co-pilot fainted alone in the cockpit, according to a report released Saturday by air accident investigators in Madrid, Spain. The incident occurred on 17 February 2024 during a scheduled flight from Frankfurt, Germany to Seville, Spain. The captain had stepped out to use the lavatory when the co-pilot suddenly lost consciousness, leaving the Airbus A321 in the hands of autopilot. Despite the co-pilot unintentionally interacting with the controls, the aircraft maintained stable flight. Investigators from the Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigation Commission in Madrid said cockpit audio captured abnormal sounds consistent with a medical emergency. Cabin crew tried to contact the co-pilot using the onboard telephone, but received no response. The captain attempted to open the cockpit door using the standard security code five times, which would normally sound a buzzer for the co-pilot to release the lock. The cockpit door, reinforced to prevent hijackings, cannot be opened by force. The captain then used an emergency override code, which initiates automatic door opening unless actively blocked from within. Just before the override would have taken effect, the co-pilot managed to unlock the door manually. He appeared extremely pale, was sweating, and making involuntary movements, according to the report. The captain retook control of the aircraft and decided to divert to Madrid, Spain. The aircraft, carrying 199 passengers and six crew members, landed safely. A doctor who was travelling on board provided medical assistance before the co-pilot was transferred to a hospital in Madrid. Medical records showed no indication of pre-existing conditions during the co-pilot’s previous examinations or recent health checks. The report has reignited discussion over cockpit protocol, particularly the long-standing debate on whether two authorised crew members should always be present in the cockpit. The Spanish investigators recommended that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency in Cologne, Germany, advise flight operators to reassess relevant guidelines. Lufthansa, which is based in Frankfurt, Germany, said its flight safety department had carried out a thorough internal review but declined to release details, citing company policy."
Pakistan,Tribune,HBL PSL returns in style,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546477/hbl-psl-returns-in-style,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,HBL PSL returns in style,"The hustle and bustle of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) returned on Friday to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium with a high-scoring clash between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings, culminating in a 23-run victory for the Kings. The PSL-10 had earlier been brought to a grinding halt after India launched a drone attack outside the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. Initially, it was decided to shift the remainder of the tournament to the UAE. However, following a de-escalation between Pakistan and India, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chose to bring the action back home and complete the event on native soil. On Friday, the PCB also officially dedicated the ongoing Pakistan Super League to the valiant Armed Forces of Pakistan, acknowledging their unwavering sacrifices and steadfast commitment to safeguarding the nation. ""We proudly dedicate the Pakistan Super League to our brave Armed Forces who continue to safeguard the nation's integrity with courage and commitment,"" the PCB said in a statement. According to the PCB, Friday's PSL matches and ceremonies were held in honour of the Pakistan Army, while Saturday would be dedicated to the Pakistan Navy, and Monday to the Pakistan Air Force. The decision has been widely welcomed by fans and the cricketing fraternity alike, who have lauded the move as a fitting tribute to the armed forces' service and sacrifices for the country. In the high-scoring encounter, Karachi Kings posted 237 runs, and Peshawar Zalmi, despite a spirited chase, fell short with 214, giving the Kings a 23-run win and securing their spot in the playoffs. Zalmi's pursuit began with flair, as young Saim Ayub provided early impetus with a fluent 47 off 31 balls, striking five boundaries and a couple of sixes. However, they suffered an early blow when Mohammad Haris was dismissed for 9 by Hasan Ali, caught by James Vince after a brief but explosive cameo. From there, Captain Babar Azam took control. Combining classical elegance with aggressive intent, he anchored the innings with sublime strokeplay. His 94 off just 49 deliveries, laced with 10 boundaries and 4 sixes, kept Zalmi in the hunt throughout. He shared crucial partnerships — first with Saim Ayub and later with Tom Kohler-Cadmore — to keep the chase alive. Despite the solid contributions, Zalmi began to lose momentum in the final overs. Kohler-Cadmore (20 off 15) and Max Bryant (7 off 5) failed to accelerate meaningfully. With the required run rate climbing steadily, the turning point came in the 18th over when Babar Azam was run out, just six runs short of his century, following a mix-up, thanks to sharp fielding by Aamer Jamal and wicketkeeper Saad Baig. Babar's dismissal effectively ended Zalmi's resistance, as the remaining batters struggled to maintain the momentum. Peshawar Zalmi eventually managed 214/5 in their 20 overs, falling short by 23 runs. With this victory, the Karachi Kings sealed their place in the playoffs. (With additional input from APP)"

The couple’s daughters, Ocean Jade Nelson-Foster and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster, were born at 31 weeks and five days after Nelson underwent emergency surgery prompted by a rare condition known as twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). A post shared by @jesynelson Nelson shared the news in an emotional Instagram post, accompanied by the first photos of the newborns being held by her and Foster. She wrote, “It all happened so quickly, but we are so blessed that they are here with us, healthy and fighting strong! We’ve never felt more in love.” While Nelson shared her joy on social media, Foster opened up about the challenges they faced during her hospital stay, which began in late March. Speaking to OK! Magazine, he said the experience brought them closer: “It’s at these times when you really know what love you have and what your relationship means. For me and Jess, this has just taken it to a whole other level.” The couple adapted to life in the hospital, with Foster converting a pull-out couch into a bed beside Nelson’s. “The nurses just said, ‘Oh my God. It looks so nice in here. It looks so homely,’” he recalled. TTTS is a serious condition that can affect identical twins sharing a placenta. Abnormal blood vessel connections in the placenta lead to an uneven blood flow between twins—putting one at risk of dehydration and the other of cardiac issues. It occurs in about 10 to 15 percent of such pregnancies, according to Professor Asma Khalil of St George’s Hospital, University of London. Now recovering at home, Nelson and Foster are hopeful and grateful, aiming to raise awareness of TTTS and encourage other parents facing complications to seek early support and medical advice."

The trucks, equipped with technology from Huawei Technologies, were developed by Huaneng Mengdong, a subsidiary of the state-owned energy conglomerate Huaneng Group. Company chairman Li Shuxue called the “Huaneng Ruichi” fleet the largest single deployment of its kind globally. “These vehicles integrate advanced technologies such as 5G-A communication, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, intelligent battery swapping, and high-precision mapping,” Li said. A post shared by Score Code Group (@scorecodegroup) The project’s technology providers include Huaneng Group, Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, and the Beijing University of Science and Technology. The driverless trucks are designed to load and unload materials autonomously and operate reliably in extreme weather, a key requirement for the often-harsh conditions of Inner Mongolia’s mining zones. Li added that the new fleet could increase transport efficiency by as much as 20% compared to conventional manned trucks. China is accelerating the integration of smart technologies in mining. According to the China National Coal Association, more than 5,000 automated mining trucks are expected to be in use across the country by the end of 2025, with that number projected to double to 10,000 by 2026."

Unlike traditional options requiring existing photos, this tool creates images from scratch, offering a new way to express personality or mood. Users may design avatars, artistic illustrations, or themed group icons without uploading personal pictures. To access the feature, users can navigate to settings and select the profile photo option, where they will see a prompt to generate an AI image. A similar process is available for editing group icons via the group info menu. The move is seen as a response to growing privacy concerns, giving users a more secure and creative alternative to using real photos. It also provides a practical solution for those without suitable profile images. While initially available to beta testers, some users on the stable iOS version have reported seeing the option, indicating a phased expansion beyond the testing pool. The update represents WhatsApp’s continuing push to integrate generative AI in everyday messaging experiences."

The revelation was part of the commission's initial finding, following the launch of its investigation on the advertising practices of the Chinese-owned short video platform in February 2024. Examples of this include content creators raving about certain products without clarifying in the video or in the description that it is a sponsorship, as part of creator guidelines and digital laws adhered to by other content-sharing platforms such as YouTube and Instagram. The EC warned that this lack of oversight hampers efforts to detect scam ads, misinformation, and coordinated influence campaigns, especially around elections. They said it had sent its preliminary findings to TikTok, which could impose a fine of up to 6% of TikTok’s global annual turnover for not complying with the DSA in publishing an advertisement repository. TikTok’s current repository lacks details on the content of ads, targeted users, and those who financed the advertisements, EU stated. EC’s investigation into TikTok’s advertising practices followed a thorough review of internal documents, tool testing, and expert interviews. The Commission stated that TikTok now has the chance to review the investigation file and respond to the findings. A post shared by European Democratic Party (@europeandemocrats) According to Reuters where a TikTok spokesperson has responded, “While we support the goals of the regulation and continue to improve our ad transparency tools, we disagree with some of the Commission's interpretations and note that guidance is being delivered via preliminary findings rather than clear, public guidelines.” If confirmed, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, could face a fine of up to 6% of its global turnover, along with increased supervision and possible penalty payments. In addition to advertising transparency, the investigation also looks into TikTok’s algorithm, its potential to cause addiction, and its impact on privacy, safety for minors, and age verification. Researchers’ access to data is also under scrutiny. Earlier in May 2025, TikTok was fined €530 million by Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner for violating the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules related to the transfer of user data to China."
Pakistan,Tribune,Bangladesh tour exposes PCB's climate blindness,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546461/bangladesh-tour-exposes-pcbs-climate-blindness,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"Faisalabad, hosting two matches, will be sizzling at 40 degrees","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided that it has heat-resistant players and spectators. Our stadiums, much like the ones in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup and the Japan National Stadium used for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, are either air-conditioned (a climate catastrophe), or smartly designed for better airflow to cool spectators. Of course in Pakistan's case, this is not true. Yet for Bangladesh's tour of Pakistanpending changes following the rejigging to the PSL schedulethe visiting team was scheduled to arrive in the country on May 25 for two T20I matches in Faisalabad, followed by three in Lahore. That schedule has now been tentatively forwarded to May 27, with venues publicly undeclared. How is the weather slated for the schedule? Faisalabad will have daytime temperatures of over 40 degrees, while Lahore is just a few degrees below. Evening temperatures remain in the 30s. As per the ICC's Future Tours Programme (FTP), Bangladesh was initially visiting for three ODIs and three T20Is. The ODIs were scrapped not because of weather, but because both cricketing boards decided that the teams would prepare for the next global tournament, the World Twenty20nevermind that the event is not to begin for another 8 months, in February 2026. While our federal government declines to use modern satellite images to sight the moon for Eid, the least that the PCB could have done is open a weather app. These schedules are clearly being made by individuals sitting in air-conditioned rooms, and who will later watch the matches from air-conditioned suites for the privileged few. The international cricket calendar has now resembled what the professional tennis calendar looks like nowthere is simply no more space. A regular conversation with the cricket calendar is that there are too many matches which lead to player fatigue. An additional conversation is needed over when we are playing those matches. Despite the T20Is against Bangladesh being night time matches, the temperature will only be marginally cooler. High performance athleticism in high temperatures poses significant risks to the human body, raising the body's core temperature that can lead to heat exhaustion causing greater cardiovascular stress and in extreme cases, even kidney failure. For fans sitting in stadiums with poor ventilation and no wind tunnels, this makes for a greatly uncomfortable viewing experience. This has been the tragedy of not developing cricket venues outside of Punjab and Karachi, it has not only halted progress in terms of developing the sport nationally, but has restricted the choice of venues that the PCB can rely on with climate change significantly altering our day to day lives, even when it comes to recreational activities. Meanwhile, cities like Quetta offer summer evenings in the 20s, and night time temperatures that Karachiites would deem chilly in winter. Ayub Stadium in Quetta has played host to two ODI matches, both against India. The first in October 1978, India narrowly won by 4 runs despite a half-century by Majid Khan, while Pakistan chased 171. The second match at Ayub Stadium took place six years later, in October 1984, which Pakistan won by 46 runs. Cricket in Quetta then shifted to the Bugti Stadium, though it only played host to one ODI between Pakistan and Zimbabwe in October 1996 which Pakistan won by three wickets, and saw the debut of 15 year old Hasan Raza."

During the opening night of his Land of Hope and Dreams tour earlier this week, Springsteen referred to the Trump administration as “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous.” He called on the crowd to rise against authoritarianism, emphasizing the role of art and music in defending democratic values. “In my home, the America I love... is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” Springsteen said. “Let freedom ring!” In response to Springsteen’s statements, Kid Rock, 54, voiced his disapproval during an appearance on Fox & Friends on Friday. He accused Springsteen of trying to gain favor with Hollywood elites and dismissed his criticism as an example of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.” “To be in Europe talking junk about our president… what a punk move,” said Rock. “This guy’s got, what, 500 million, a billion dollars… and is out there playing like he’s a working-class hero.” Springsteen added further remarks later in his set, stating, “The last check on power after the checks and balances of government have failed are the people, you and me.” The commentary didn’t go unnoticed by Trump, 78, who reacted on his platform, TruthSocial. He dismissed Springsteen as “Highly Overrated,” calling him a “pushy, obnoxious JERK” and criticizing his political affiliations with former President Joe Biden."

Critics argue the body has been inconsistent after Australian batter Usman Khawaja was blocked from displaying a dove symbol late in 2023 and the phrase ""All lives are equal"" in support of peace in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Jay Shah, the ICC Chairman and secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), publicly shared support for the Indian military — raising many to question ICC's policy enforcement. Critics like Malcolm Conn were among the first to criticise the disparity. Conn posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account, questioning ICC's stance on both issues, whilst citing Times of India. The post triggered widespread debate about Shah's role in the ICC and his wider influence on world cricket. Cricket bats When questioned about Shah's dual roles, Conn responded, ""Had he resigned as ICC chief?"" Critics have pointed out that Khawaja's peaceful message was apolitical in comparison to military endorsements, prompting further scrutiny of the ICC's approach. While the ICC maintains a strict policy against political messaging on the field, observers argue the rules appear selectively enforced. Jay Shah's position as the son of India's Home Minister Amit Shah and his high-profile involvement in both Indian cricket and the ICC has only intensified the scrutiny. Many are now calling on the ICC to clarify its standards and apply them uniformly. Roston Chase appointed WI Test captain Roston Chase has been appointed West Indies' new Test captain. The allrounder's first Test as captain will be his 50th; his 49th, against South Africa in Johannesburg, came more than two years ago. West Indies have played 13 Tests since then. Chase has previously led West Indies in one ODI and one T20I. His first assignment in the longest format will be the three-Test home series against Australia, which begins on his home ground in Bridgetown on June 25. Left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican will be Chase's vice-captain. The series will be the first of the 2025-27 World Test Championship cycle for both teams. CWI said that Chase had been appointed from a shortlist of six after a ""detailed assessment process that included psychometric testing to evaluate leadership style, behaviour, and overall suitability for the role"". The other candidates interviewed were John Campbell, Tevin Imlach, Joshua Da Silva, Justin Greaves, and Warrican. Shai Hope, West Indies captain in the white-ball formats, asked not to be considered in order to focus on his exciting leadership roles. ""This selection process is one of the most comprehensive and forward-thinking we have undertaken,"" CWI president, Kishore Shallow, said. ""I am deeply impressed by the professionalism, objectivity, and strategic thinking that shaped the final decision. It sets a new benchmark for leadership appointments in West Indies cricket."" West Indies head coach, Daren Sammy, said: ""I fully endorse this appointment. Our new captain has earned the respect of his peers, understands the responsibility that comes with the role, and has shown the leadership qualities we need to take this team forward. I urge fans across the region to rally behind him--we're building something special."" The 33-year-old Chase takes over from Kraigg Brathwaite, who resigned in March after 39 matches in charge of the Test team. West Indies won 10 of those Tests, lost 22 and drew seven. At the time of Brathwaite's resignation, CWI had handed Hope - already West Indies' ODI captain - the T20I reins, but had held back on naming a new Test captain, announcing that they would do so ""in the coming weeks"". Brathwaite's tenure was notable for a young West Indies team beginning to find ways of winning in different conditions with a growing pool of fast and spin bowlers. Notable performances included a 1-0 home series win over England in 2022, the Gabba Test win of January 2024, and a 1-1 draw in Pakistan in Brathwaite's last series in charge, in January 2025."

While no official announcements have been made, fans are closely watching veteran performers Mikey Day, Heidi Gardner, and especially longtime Weekend Update co-anchors Michael Che and Colin Jost. Historically, major cast departures are confirmed during the season finale, meaning answers may arrive during the live broadcast on May 17, 2025. The show often undergoes subtle behind-the-scenes staff changes between seasons, but this year’s attention is firmly on its most established personalities. Gardner has been part of the cast since 2017, and Day, who began as a writer in 2013, joined the cast in 2016. However, most speculation centers around Che and Jost, who have become fixtures behind the Weekend Update desk. Che joined the writing staff in 2013 and began anchoring Weekend Update in 2014. Though he previously considered stepping down in 2022, he continued and now ranks as the second-longest-serving Update host after Jost. Jost, who started as a writer in 2005, served as co-head writer twice and joined the Weekend Update desk in 2014. He became the longest-running anchor in the segment’s history in 2021. Unlike Che, who mentioned possible departure plans during a February comedy show, Jost has remained publicly silent. With his wife Scarlett Johansson hosting the finale, some fans wonder if he will use the occasion to announce his exit. If both leave, it would be the first time since 2000 that Weekend Update lacks a returning anchor. While replacements haven’t been confirmed, cast member Michael Longfellow and Update writer Rosebud Baker are seen as possible successors. Viewers will find out during tonight’s live episode."
Pakistan,Tribune,Swedish mom fined over TikTok egg prank after court rules it harassment toward daughter,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546507/swedish-mom-fined-over-tiktok-egg-prank-after-court-rules-it-harassment-toward-daughter,"May 18, 2025",Tribune News Desk,"A Helsingborg mother must pay $2,055 after cracking egg on daughter’s head in viral TikTok prank gone wrong.","A Swedish woman has been convicted of harassment and ordered to pay damages to her daughter after a viral TikTok prank backfired. As reported by Pubity, the 24-year-old mother from Helsingborg cracked an egg on her daughter’s head in 2023, participating in a widespread TikTok trend at the time. #eggprank #pranks #funnyvideos #funny #funnytiktoks #viral #fyp The case stems from a once-popular internet prank that gained traction among parents on TikTok. Typically carried out during baking sessions, the prank involves parents pretending to crack an egg into a bowl, only to unexpectedly break it on their child’s head. The video, which was shared publicly on TikTok, caught the attention of a viewer who reported it to the police. Authorities launched an investigation that ultimately led to the mother being charged with harassment. In 2025, the Helsingborg District Court found her guilty and ordered her to pay her daughter SEK 20,000—equivalent to approximately $2,055 USD. Prosecutor Cecilia Andersson, speaking to reporters, argued that the act was “degrading” and that the mother had acted recklessly by broadcasting the incident for online attention. “It’s a little girl who thinks she’s going to bake an apple cake with her mom... then all of a sudden, she gets an egg cracked in her forehead,” Andersson said. “This is a reckless act.” Despite defending herself in court by saying she was simply joining in on a viral trend—“Everyone was doing it,” she claimed—the court did not accept the justification. The case has sparked renewed discussions around the ethical boundaries of online content involving children, especially when it involves public humiliation for the sake of social media virality. The incident serves as a cautionary tale for parents and content creators alike, highlighting the real-world consequences of participating in online trends without considering the potential legal and emotional impact."
